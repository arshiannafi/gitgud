Fix to handle app name specifications with slashes. The is the CLI ... (#471)  change to match the corresponding server change deployed a couple days back.  Here are details of the issue: // IIS and Azure web apps have this annoying behavior where %2F (URL encoded slashes) in the URL are URL decoded // BEFORE the requests reach node. That essentially means there's no good way to encode a "/" in the app name-- // URL encodeing will work when running locally but when running on Azure it gets decoded before express sees it // so app names with slashes don't get routed properly. See https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode/issues/343 (or other sites // that complain about the same) for some more info. I explored some IIS config based workarounds but the previous // link seems to say they won't work so I eventually gave up on that. // Anyway to workaround this issue we now allow the client to encode / characters as ~~ (two tildes URL encoded). // The CLI now converts / to ~~ if / appears in an app name before passing that as part of the URL. This code below // does the encoding. It's hack but seems like the least bad option here. // Eventually this service will go away & we'll all be on Max's new service. That's hosted in docker no more IIS // so this issue should go away then., 43459513, 2718, 235, 2718

command-executor: search for gradle properties across all `gradle.properties` files (#365)  In case if there are both `android/app/gradle.properties` and `android/gradle.properties` exist  only the first one is considered. Improvement for https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/660, 43459513, 2718, 235, 2718
command-executor: fix versionName parsing issue (#358)  Implement workaround for the case when 'build.gradle' file contains several 'android' nodes. In this case 'buildGradle.android' prop (parsed by 'gradle-to-js' library) represents array instead of object due to parsing issue in 'g2js.parseFile' method., 43459513, 2718, 235, 2718
debug: fix android device detection (#357)  Replace 'isDeviceAvailable' method with 'getNumberOfAvailableDevices' method add new throw statement in case more than 1 attached android device was detected because for now there is no ability to specify device for debug like 'code-push debug android "192.168.121.102:5555"'. Fix issue https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/352, 43459513, 2718, 235, 2718

Merge pull request #3 from Zoltu/patch-1  Process.MainModule should not ensure NotNull., 28880434, 671, 126, 671
Process.MainModule should not ensure NotNull.  As seen in http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs493 Process.MainModule can return null for non Windows NT operating systems.  This includes Legacy versions of Windows Xbox Unix MacOSX etc.  The comment at http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/services/monitoring/system/diagnosticts/Process.cs472 sheds a little light on the scenarios that could result in a null Main Module and includes "Possibly other" which means Code Contracts cannot reasonably assert that MainModule returns NotNull., 28880434, 671, 126, 671

Add a note about HADOOP_USER_NAME  fixes #48 #49, 50265260, 5, 2, 5
Fixed incorrect Append implementation.  The previous implementation considered existing blocks immutable which is not correct.  This commit attempts to unfinalize the last existing block during an append operation so that it may be written to again. This is done by submitting the correct stage `hdfs.OpWriteBlockProto_PIPELINE_SETUP_APPEND` during the initial OpWriteBlock operation. Additionally `blockWriteStream`s are now always initialized with an offset which will be > 0 in case of append operation. Finally the GenerationStamp field is incremented at the beginning of the append operation which is an incrementing integer that records the version of a particular block., 50265260, 5, 2, 5

Make ClientName unique per client; tie it to client id  Confusingly HDFS has two ideas for keeping track of clients; the client ID which must be 16 bytes and is passed with the RPC header; and the client  "name" which can be longer and is passed with some miscellaneous RPC requests.  This change makes them tied to one another--the client name is a (more) human-readable form of the ID. We also make sure to generate a separate ID per client object so hadoop doesn't get confused., 50265260, 5, 2, 5

[Sanitizer] Replace diagnostic string literal to workaround CMake 2.8 bug.  Let me tell you a story. Suppose you want to build your project (e.g. LLVM) with CMake 2.8 Clang and AddressSanitizer. You also want to ensure that Clang is fresh enough and check that CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION is 3.1+. This check would fail - CMake would fail to correctly calculate compiler version if you pass CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address.  The problem is funky compiler version calculation in CMakeDetermineCompilerId.cmake module: it compiles the sample source file with provided compiler and compile flags runs "strings" and greps for "INFO:" ASCII strings contained on the executable to fetch "INFO:compiler" "INFO:compiler_version" etc. It limits the output of grep to just 4 lines.  Unfortunately if your executable was built with ASan it would also contain an ASCII string   INFO: %s ignores mlock/mlockall/munlock/munlockall and INFO:compiler_version string would never be parsed.  All of the above actually happened after r243574 when we tried to configure libcxx with just-built Clang with TSan/MSan and the version check mentioned above failed in HandleLLVMOptions.cmake  (╯°□°)╯.~.┻━┻  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@243599 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[asantsanmsan] move the memcmp interceptor from asan/tsan to sanitizer_common. This may potentially lead to more reports from msan as it now sees the reads inside memcmp.

[asan] Remove special case mapping on Android/AArch64.  ASan shadow on Android starts at address 0 for both historic and performance reasons. This is possible because the platform mandates -pie which makes lower memory region always available.  This is not such a good idea on 64-bit platforms because of MAP_32BIT incompatibility.

Let cmake infer source file language by the file extension.  This applies default compiler flags to .S files in particular removing the "-pedantic" option which is desirable because there is nothing to reasonably warn about; and the only thing that gcc warns about is that you allegedly can't correctly invoke GLUE2 in lib/builtins/assembly.h on platforms for which USER_LABEL_PREFIX is the empty string.  In the gcc bug https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33305 that added the warning a commenter notes that giving a macro of zero characters to another macro is not precisely the same as failing to supply an argument and "there is a widespread belief in C++ community that such usage is valid". Unfortunately the only way to silence the warning is to avoid -pedantic.

[asan] Rename the ABI versioning symbol to '__asan_version_mismatch_check' instead of abusing '__asan_init'  We currently version `__asan_init` and when the ABI version doesn't match the linker gives a `undefined reference to '__asan_init_v5'` message. From this it might not be obvious that it's actually a version mismatch error. This patch makes the error message much clearer by changing the name of the undefined symbol to be `__asan_version_mismatch_check_xxx` (followed by the version string). We obviously don't want the initializer to be named like that so it's a separate symbol that is used only for the purpose of version checking.

Specifically:  - Disable int128 tests on Windows as MSVC cl.exe does not support   int128 so we might not have been able to build the runtime   with int128 support.  - XFAIL the vptr tests as we lack Microsoft ABI support.  - XFAIL enum.cpp as UBSan fails to add the correct instrumentation code   for some reason.  - Modify certain tests that build executables multiple times to use   unique names for each executable. This works around a race condition   observed on Windows.  - Implement IsAccessibleMemoryRange for Windows to fix the last   misaligned.cpp test.  - Introduce a substitution for testing crashes on Windows using   KillTheDoctor.

[msan] Fix infinite recursion when _Unwind_Backtrace calls memcpy  Summary: On PPC64 half the msan tests fail with an infinite recursion through GetStackTrace like this:  #0 __msan::GetStackTrace #1 __msan_memcpy #2 ?? () from /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 #3 ?? () from /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 #4 _Unwind_Backtrace #5 __sanitizer::BufferedStackTrace::SlowUnwindStack #6 __sanitizer::BufferedStackTrace::Unwind #7 __msan::GetStackTrace #8 __interceptor_calloc #9 _dl_allocate_tls #10 pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.17 #11 __interceptor_pthread_create #12 main  The problem is that we call _Unwind_Backtrace to get a stack trace; but _Unwind_Backtrace calls memcpy which we intercept and try to get another stack trace.  This patch fixes it in __msan_memcpy by skipping the stack trace if IsInSymbolizer(). This works because GetStackTrace already creates a SymbolizerScope to "block reports from our interceptors during _Unwind_Backtrace".

[asan] Do not unset DYLD_ROOT_PATH before calling atos on Darwin  We were unsetting DYLD_ROOT_PATH before calling atos on Darwin in order to address it not working for symbolicating 32 bit binaries. (atos essentiall tries to respawn as a 32 bit binary and it's disallowed to respawn if DYLD_ROOT_PATH is set ... ) However processes rely on having DYLD_ROOT_PATH set under certain conditions so this is not the right fix. In particular this always crashes when running ASanified process under the debugger in Xcode with iOS simulator which is a very important workflow for us to support.  This patch reverts the unsetting of the DYLD_ROOT_PATH.

[ASan] Test churn for setting ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize_vs_style=false  Summary: This commit adds symbolize_vs_style=false to every instance of ASAN_OPTIONS in the asan tests and sets ASAN_OPTIONS=symbolize_vs_style=false in lit for tests which don't set it.  This way we don't need to make the tests be able to deal with both symbolize styles.  This is the first patch in the series. I will eventually submit for the other sanitizers too.  We need this change (or another way to deal with the different outputs) in order to be able to default to symbolize_vs_style=true on some platforms.  Adding to this change I'm also adding "env " before any command line which sets environment variables. That way the test works on other host shells like we have if the host is running Windows.

Add descriptive names to sanitizer entries in /proc/self/maps. Helps debugging.  This is done by creating a named shared memory region unlinking it and setting up a private (i.e. copy-on-write) mapping of that instead of a regular anonymous mapping. I've experimented with regular (sparse) files but they can not be scaled to the size of MSan shadow mapping at least on Linux/X86_64 and ext3 fs.  Controlled by a common flag decorate_proc_maps disabled by default.  This patch has a few shortcomings: * not all mappings are annotated especially in TSan. * our handling of memset() of shadow via mmap() puts small anonymous   mappings inside larger named mappings which looks ugly and can in   theory hit the mapping number limit.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@238621 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Mprotect all inaccessible memory regions.  Fix 2 bugs in memory mapping setup: - the invalid region at offset 0 was not protected because mmap at   address 0 fails with EPERM on most Linux systems. We did not   notice this because the check condition was flipped: the code was   checking that mprotect has failed. And the test that was supposed   to catch this was weakened by the mitigations in the mmap   interceptor. - when running without origins the origin shadow range was left   unprotected.  The new test ensures that mmap w/o MAP_FIXED always returns valid application addresses.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@238109 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[Builtins] Implement half-precision conversions.  Mostly uninteresting except: - in __extendXfYf2 when checking if the number is normal the old   code relied on the unsignedness of src_rep_t which is a problem   when sizeof(src_rep_t) < sizeof(int): the result gets promoted to   int the signedness of which breaks the comparison.   I added an explicit cast; it shouldn't affect other types. - we can't pass __fp16 so src_t and src_rep_t are the same. - the gnu_*_ieee symbols are simply duplicated definitions as aliases   are problematic on mach-o (where only weak aliases are supported;   that's not what we want).

This change is the first of 3 patches to add support for specifying the profile output from the command line via -fprofile-instr-generate=<path> where the specified output path/file will be overridden by the LLVM_PROFILE_FILE environment variable.  Several changes are made to the runtime to support this:  Add a new interface __llvm_profile_override_default_filename that will set the profile output filename but allows LLVM_PROFILE_FILE to override. This is the interface used by the new option.  Refactor the pid-expansion done for LLVM_PROFILE_FILE into a separate routine that can be shared by the various filename setting routines (so that the filename from the option can also use the "%p" syntax).  Move the truncation into setFilename and only truncate if there is a new filename specified (to maintain support for appending to the same profile file in the case of multiple shared objects built with profiling).  Move the handling for a NULL filename passed to __llvm_profile_set_filename and __llvm_profile_override_default_filename into the new setFilenamePossiblyWithPid routine. This now correctly resets the output file to default.profraw instead of NULL. The handling for a null LLVM_PROFILE_FILE (which should not reset) is done by caller setFilenameFromEnvironment.

Add hard float versions of FP to LL conversions  This adds hard-float implementation for the following builtins:  * __fixdfdi() * __fixsfdi() * __fixunsdfdi() * __fixunssfdi()  The soft-float implementation does never raise floating point exceptions which doesn't allow clients to detect floating point conversion errors.

[UBSan] Embed UBSan into ASan runtime (compiler-rt part).  Summary: Change the way we use ASan and UBSan together. Instead of keeping two separate runtimes (libclang_rt.asan and libclang_rt.ubsan) embed UBSan into ASan and get rid of libclang_rt.ubsan. If UBSan is not supported on a platform all UBSan sources are just compiled into dummy empty object files. UBSan initialization code (e.g. flag parsing) is directly called from ASan initialization so we are able to enforce correct initialization order.  This mirrors the approach we already use for ASan+LSan. This change doesn't modify the way we use standalone UBSan.

asan: optimization experiments  The experiments can be used to evaluate potential optimizations that remove instrumentation (assess false negatives). Instead of completely removing some instrumentation you set Exp to a non-zero value (mask of optimization experiments that want to remove instrumentation of this instruction). If Exp is non-zero this pass will emit special calls into runtime (e.g. __asan_report_exp_load1 instead of __asan_report_load1). These calls make runtime terminate the program in a special way (with a different exit status). Then you run the new compiler on a buggy corpus collect the special terminations (ideally you don't see them at all -- no false negatives) and make the decision on the optimization.  The exact reaction to experiments in runtime is not implemented in this patch. It will be defined and implemented in a subsequent patch.  http://reviews.llvm.org/D8198    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@232501 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer/coverage] Add AFL-style coverage counters (search heuristic for fuzzing).  Introduce -mllvm -sanitizer-coverage-8bit-counters=1 which adds imprecise thread-unfriendly 8-bit coverage counters.  The run-time library maps these 8-bit counters to 8-bit bitsets in the same way AFL (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/technical_details.txt) does: counter values are divided into 8 ranges and based on the counter value one of the bits in the bitset is set. The AFL ranges are used here: 1 2 3 4-7 8-15 16-31 32-127 128+.  These counters provide a search heuristic for single-threaded coverage-guided fuzzers we do not expect them to be useful for other purposes.  Depending on the value of -fsanitize-coverage=[123] flag these counters will be added to the function entry blocks (=1) every basic block (=2) or every edge (=3).  Use these counters as an optional search heuristic in the Fuzzer library. Add a test where this heuristic is critical.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@231166 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Allow sanitizer to work with "old" kernel headers  Sanitizers work on ancient kernels and were depending on types existing. When those types were removed the sanitizer build broke. See bug https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59009 for more information.  This patch fixes it by isolating the need for those types only when the feature is actually needed thus allowing one to compile the kernel with or without that change irrespective of its version.

Fix the ASan ioctl.cc test when using COMPILER_RT_DEBUG=On  In debug mode (COMPILER_RT_DEBUG=On) we still build with -fomit-frame-pointer and wrap_ioctl doesn't set up a proper stack frame.  In release mode it does because ioctl_common_pre gets inlined into wrap_ioctl and it uses the COMMON_INTERCEPTOR_READ_RANGE macro which in the end calls GET_CURRENT_FRAME and that forces the compiler to generate a stack frame for the function.  Not having a proper stack frame breaks the unwinder.  This patch forces to generate a frame pointer (via ENABLE_FRAME_POINTER macro).

Fix gc-test.cc to work under higher -O levels  The gc-test.cc tries underflows of a variable up to -32 bytes but on i386 the left redzone is not 32 bytes it’s only 16 bytes and therefore the access to var[-32] is completely off. The reason why this test didn’t fail before is that we’ve been lucky and there was another variable before the var array which was also instrumented.

tsan: fix PTRACE_ATTACH handling during stop-the-world  If the thread receives a signal concurrently with PTRACE_ATTACH we can get notification about the signal before notification about stop. In such case we need to forward the signal to the thread otherwise the signal will be missed (as we do PTRACE_DETACH with arg=0) and any logic relying on signals will break. After forwarding we need to continue to wait for stopping because the thread is not stopped yet. We do ignore delivery of SIGSTOP because we want to make stop-the-world as invisible as possible.  http://reviews.llvm.org/D7723   --This line and those below will be ignored-- M    lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_stoptheworld_linux_libcdep.cc M    test/tsan/signal_segv_handler.cc   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@229832 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[UBSan] Allow UBSan location to store frames returned by symbolizer.  Summary: __ubsan::getFunctionLocation() used to issue a call to symbolizer and convert the result (SymbolizedStack) to one of UBSan structures: SourceLocation ModuleLocation or MemoryLocation. This: (1) is inefficient: we do an extra allocation/deallocation to copy data while we can instead can just pass SymbolizedStack around (which contains all the necessary data). (2) leaks memory: strings stored in SourceLocation/MemoryLocation are never deallocated and Filipe Cabecinhas suggests this causes crashes of UBSan-ified programs in the wild.  Instead let Location store a pointer to SymbolizedStack object and make sure it's properly deallocated when UBSan handler exits.  ModuleLocation is made obsolete by this change and is deleted.

Fix ASan's Noinst unit tests  We currently skip all "Noinst" unit tests on OS X which was probably caused when we removed the "allow_reexec" flag. The MaybeReexec function fails to re-execute when the runtime is linked statically because there is no dylib to use. This patch adds an explicit DisableReexec function that is used from asan_noinst_test.cc and the runtime then doesn't try to re-execute.

[UBSan] Reduce the number of getCallerLocation() calls.  getCallerLocation() is expensive as it issues a call to symbolizer. (In fact this function has a memory leak at the moment but this will be fixed in the nearest future). We should only call it if we're actually going to print an error report in particular once for every reported source location.  __ubsan_handle_type_mismatch: call getCallerLocation() only if provided source location is invalid and only if the report is not deduplicated.  __ubsan_handle_float_cast_overflow: call getSourceLocation with correct CallerPC (the one in user code not in UBSan handler).

[compiler-rt] Make MaybeReexec properly process DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES when using non-absolute paths  MaybeReexec() in asan_mac.cc checks for presence of the ASan dylib in DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES and if it is there it will process this env. var. and remove the dylib from its value so that spawned children don't have this variable set. However the current implementation only works when using a canonical absolute path to the dylib it fails to remove the dylib for example when using @executable_path.  This patch changes the processing of DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to comparing values only based on filenames (ignoring directories).

[compiler-rt] Ensure AsanInitFromRtl is called from a static initializer on OS X by using ASAN_DYNAMIC=1  The idea is to ensure that the ASan runtime gets initialized early (i.e. before other initializers/constructors) even when DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is not used. In that case the interceptors are not installed (on OS X DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES is required for interceptors to work) and therefore ASan gets currently initialized quite late -- from the main executable's module initializer. The following issues are a consequence of this:    https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=363   https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=357  Both of them are fixed with this patch.

Fix/workaround for OS X truncated stacktraces taken by external tools  This patch is a proposed solution for https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=375:  When the stacktraces are captured and printed by ASan itself they are fine but when the program has already printed the report (or is just printing it) capturing a stacktrace via other means is broken. "Other means" include OS X CrashReporter debuggers or calling backtrace() within the program. For example calling backtrace() from a sanitizer_set_death_callback function prints a very truncated stacktrace.

tests: correct builtins test if built under -mthumb on ARM  The clear_cache and enable_execute_stack tests attempt to memcpy the definition of a function into a buffer before executing the function.  The problem with this approach is that on some targets (ARM with thumb mode compilation MIPS with MIPS16 codegen or uMIPS) you would use a pointer which is incorrect (it would be off-by-one) due to the ISA selection being encoded into the address.

AddressSanitizer: Properly handle dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler with a NULL handler  Per https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html the dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler() API *can* be called with a NULL handler. In that case the libdispatch removes an already existing cancellation handler if there was one. ASan's interceptor always creates a new block that always tries to call the original handler. In case the original block is NULL a segmentation fault happens. Let's fix that by not wrapping a NULL-block at all.  It looks like all the other libdispatch APIs (which we intercept) do *not* allow NULL. So it's really only the dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler one that needs this fix.

Enforce that ParseCommonFlagsFromString() and SetCommonFlagsDefaults() work only with singleton CommonFlags shared across all sanitizer runtimes.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@224617 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[ASan] Change activation strategy.  Now ASan deactivation doesn't modify common or ASan-specific runtime flags. Flags stay constant after initialization and "deactivation" instead stashes initialized runtime state and deactivates the runtime. Activation then just restores the original state (possibly overriden by some activation flags provided in system property on Android).  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@224614 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Introduce AllocatorOptions to configure allocator behavior.  Summary: Reduce the dependency of allocator code on runtime flags.

[ASan] Restrict the set of flags overriden at activation.  Summary: Change the way ASan flag parsing is performed at activation: instead of overwriting all ASan and common flags from the activation string ASan will now only override a handful of whitelisted flags. This is a first step towards making runtime flags immutable after initialization. I plan to re-factor the activation stragegy to the following one:    - Parse commandline flags. Override the defaults from compile     definition env var etc. Flags are immutable at this point.   - Initiailize the runtime from commandline flags.   - If ASan needs to be started deactivated stash the runtime     state in "asan_deactivated_flags" and deactivate the runtime.   - When ASan is activated override "asan_deactivated_flags" with     activation flags and use it to re-activate the runtime.

builtins: rely on the compiler for user label prefix  clang does not like the definition of builtins.  In order to work around this we use a SUN CC to redefine the generated name.

[ASan] Always build shared ASan runtime on Linux.  This commit changes the strategy for building shared ASan runtime and the way we test it:   - COMPILER_RT_BUILD_SHARED_ASAN CMake option is removed. We now     always build shared ASan runtime (it is the default on Android     Windows and Mac and not the default on Linux and FreeBSD).   - Platforms which use static runtime by default now have     "check-asan-dynamic" testsuite. This testsuite contains instrumented     unit tests and ASan lit tests and runs them with shared ASan     runtime. This testsuite is *not* a part of "check-asan" and     *not* a part of "check-all" as adding 1000 more test cases which     duplicate existing ones is costly.

[Sanitizer] Introduce Allocator::may_return_null bool flag.  Summary: Turn "allocator_may_return_null" common flag into an Allocator::may_return_null bool flag.

[ASan] Change fake stack and local variables handling.  This commit changes the way we get fake stack from ASan runtime (to find use-after-return errors) and the way we represent local variables:   - __asan_stack_malloc function now returns pointer to newly allocated     fake stack frame or NULL if frame cannot be allocated. It doesn't     take pointer to real stack as an input argument it is calculated     inside the runtime.   - __asan_stack_free function doesn't take pointer to real stack as     an input argument. Now this function is never called if fake stack     frame wasn't allocated.   - __asan_init version is bumped to reflect changes in the ABI.   - new flag "-asan-stack-dynamic-alloca" allows to store all the     function local variables in a dynamic alloca instead of the static     one. It reduces the stack space usage in use-after-return mode     (dynamic alloca will not be called if the local variables are stored     in a fake stack) and improves the debug info quality for local     variables (they will not be described relatively to %rbp/%rsp which     are assumed to be clobbered by function calls). This flag is turned     off by default for now but I plan to turn it on after more     testing.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@224063 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan LSan] Improve tracking of thread creation.  In the current scheme of things the call to ThreadStart() in the child thread is not synchronized with the parent thread. So if a pointer is passed to pthread_create there may be a window of time during which this pointer will not be discoverable by LSan. I.e. the pthread_create interceptor has already returneed and thus the pointer is no longer on the parent stack but we don't yet know the location of the child stack. This has caused bogus leak reports (see http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21621/).  This patch makes the pthread_create interceptor wait until the child thread is properly registered before returning.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@223419 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Change the way origin ids are built.  Previously all origin ids were "chained" origins i.e values of ChainedOriginDepot. This added a level of indirection for simple stack and heap allocation which were represented as chains of length 1. This costs both RAM and CPU but provides a joined 2**29 origin id space. It also made function (any instrumented function) entry non-async-signal-safe but that does not really matter because memory stores in track-origins=2 mode are not async-signal-safe anyway.  With this change the type of the origin is encoded in origin id. See comment in msan_origin.h for more details. This reduces chained and stack origin id range to 2**28 each but leaves extra 2**31 for heap origins.  This change should not have any user-visible effects.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@223233 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[Sanitizer] Introduce generic stack frame rendering machinery  Summary: This commit introduces function __sanitizer::RenderFrame() that allows to render the contents of AddressInfo (essentially symbolized stack frame) using the custom format string.

[TSan] Keep original function and filename in ReportStack.  TSan used to do the following transformations with data obtained from the symbolizer: 1) Strip "__interceptor_" prefix from function name. 2) Use "strip_path_prefix" runtime flag to strip filepath.  Now these transformations are performed right before the stack trace is printed and ReportStack structure contains original information.  This seems like a right thing to do - stripping is a detail of report formatting implementation and should belong there. We should for example use original path to source file when we apply suppressions.  This change also make "strip_path_prefix" flag behavior in TSan consistent with all the other sanitizers - now it should actually match *the prefix* of path not some substring. E.g. earlier TSan would turn "/usr/lib/libfoo.so" into "libfoo.so" even if strip_path_prefix was "/lib/".  Finally strings obtained from symbolizer come from internal allocator and "stripping" them early by incrementing a "char*" ensures they can never be properly deallocated which is a bug.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@221283 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Clang driver then sets the "-rpath" to be the real path to where clang currently has the dylib (because clang uses the relative path to its current executable).

[Sanitizer] Make StackTrace a lightweight reference to array of PCs and introduce a BufferedStackTrace class which owns this array.  Summary: This change splits __sanitizer::StackTrace class into a lightweight __sanitizer::StackTrace which doesn't own array of PCs and BufferedStackTrace which owns it. This would allow us to simplify the interface of StackDepot and eventually merge __sanitizer::StackTrace with __tsan::StackTrace.  Test Plan: regression test suite.

[compiler-rt] Enable ASAN for powerpc64le-linux  Whitespace update for lint check by myself (Will).  Otherwise code and comments by Peter Bergner as previously seen on llvm-commits.       The following patch gets ASAN somewhat working on powerpc64le-linux.     It currently assumes the LE kernel uses 46-bit addressing which is     true but it doesn't solve the case for BE where it may be 44 or     46 bits.  That can be fixed with a follow on patch.          There are some test suite fails even with this patch that I haven't had     time to solve yet but this is better than the state it is in now.     The limited debugging of those test suite fails seems to show that the     address map for 46-bit addressing has changed and so we'll need to     modify the shadow memory location slightly.  Again that can be fixed     with a follow on patch.     git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@219827 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

builtins: rework use of DEFINE_COMPILERRT_THUMB_FUNCTION  This is simply to help clarity of the code.  The functions are built as thumb only if Thumb2 is available (__ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB == 2).

[compiler-rt] ASan debugging API for report info extraction and locating addresses  Reviewed at http://reviews.llvm.org/D4527  This patch is part of an effort to implement a more generic debugging API as proposed in http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-July/074656.html with first part reviewed at http://reviews.llvm.org/D4466. Now adding several new APIs: __asan_report_present __asan_get_report_{pcbpspaddresstypesizedescription} __asan_locate_address. These return whether an asan report happened yet the PC BP SP address access type (read/write) access size and bug description (e.g. "heap-use-after-free") __asan_locate_address takes a pointer and tries to locate it i.e. say whether it is a heap pointer a global or a stack or whether it's a pointer into the shadow memory. If global or stack tries to also return the variable name address and size. If heap tries to return the chunk address and size. Generally these should serve as an alternative to "asan_describe_address" which only returns all the data in text form. Having an API to get these data could allow having debugging scripts/extensions that could show additional information about a variable/expression/pointer.

tsan: more careful handling of signals On some tests we see that signals are not delivered when a thread is blocked in epoll_wait. The hypothesis is that the signal is delivered right before epoll_wait call. The signal is queued as in_blocking_func is not set yet and then the thread just blocks in epoll_wait forever. So double check pending signals *after* setting in_blocking_func. This way we either queue a signal and handle it in the beginning of a blocking func or process the signal synchronously if it's delivered when in_blocking_func is set.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@218070 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

PR20721: Don't let UBSan print inaccessible memory  Summary: UBSan needs to check if memory snippet it's going to print resides in addressable memory. Similar check might be helpful in ASan with dump_instruction_bytes option (see http://reviews.llvm.org/D5167).  Instead of scanning /proc/self/maps manually delegate this check to the OS kernel: try to write this memory in a syscall and assume that memory is inaccessible if the syscall failed (e.g. with EFAULT).

profile: Avoid name collisions between instrumentation and runtime  The naming scheme we're using for counters in profile data shares a prefix with some fixed names we use for the runtime notably __llvm_profile_data_begin and _end. Embarrassingly this means a function called begin() can't be instrumented.  This modifies the runtime names so as not to collide with the instrumentation.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@217166 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan: disable getpwent interceptors  There interceptors do not seem to be strictly necessary for tsan. But we see cases where the interceptors consume 70% of execution time. Memory blocks passed to fgetgrent_r are "written to" by tsan several times. First there is some recursion (getgrnam_r calls fgetgrent_r) and each function "writes to" the buffer. Then the same memory is "written to" twice first as buf and then as pwbufp (both of them refer to the same addresses).     git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@216904 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

DFSan's set label function should avoid writing to the shadow memory when the write would not change the value in memory.  When writing a label to shadow memory don't write if the value is already set to the value being written.  This dramatically reduces real memory consumption in programs with sparse use of labels.  Test Plan: It would be nice to test that unnecessary writes are skipped but I do not see how a unit test could do this.  Patch by Sam Kerner!

builtins: make ARM compilation with GAS work again  The LLVM IAS seems to accept wide instructions for add and sub in ARM mode even though it is not permitted.  This uses a macro to ensure that the wide modifier is only applied when building in THUMB mode.  This repairs building with GCC/GAS in ARM mode.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214046 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
builtins: move macro definitions into assembly.h  The macro definitions are shared across multiple files.

builtins: avoid multiple definitions of symbols  The architecture specific implementation of routines would be built and included along with the generic implementation.  This would result in multiple definitions of those symbols.  The linker is free to select either of the two.  Most of the time this shouldn't be too terrible as the forward iteration should catch the architecture version due to the ordering.  Rather than relying on the linker and build infrastructure ordering things in a specific manner only provide the architecture version when available.  This reduces the size of compiler-rt simplifies inspection of the library implementations and guarantees that the desired version is selected at a slightly complex build system.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214040 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
builtins: add missed files from previous commits  This adds missed files in SVN r214033 for alignment and corrects a change from SVN r214034 for fixing compilation with GCC.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214039 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
builtins: move the readonly constants into rodata  Place the floating point constants into the read-only data section.  This was already being done for x86_64 this simply mirrors the behaviour for i686.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214034 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
builtins: correct constant alignments  MMX/SSE instructions expect 128-bit alignment (16-byte) for constants that they reference.  Correct the alignment on the constant values.  Although it is quite possible for the data to end up aligned there is no guarantee that this will occur unless it is explicitly aligned to the desired location.  If the data ends up being unaligned the resultant binary would fault at runtime due to the unaligned access.  As an example the follow would fault previously:   cc -c lib/builtins/x86_64/floatundidf.S -o floatundidf.o   cc -c test/builtins/Unit/floatundidf_test.c -o floatundidf_test.c   ld -m elf_x86_64 floatundidf.o floatundidf_test.o -lc -o floatundidf  However if the object files were reversed the data would end up aligned and the problem would go unnoticed.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214033 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

builtins: re-enable building assembly sources  Re-apply SVN r213684 which was reverted in SVN r213724 since it broke the build bots.  Add a tweak to enable inclusion of the assembly sources in standalone build as well.  Original commit message:  This patch address the PR20360. The CMake assembler build system ignores the .S assembly files in builtins library build. This patch fixes the issue.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214013 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
builtins: make the x86_64 compatible with GAS  The .rodata directive was added on the IA-64 (Itanium) platform.  The LLVM IAS supports the .rodata on i386 and x86_64 as well.  There is no reason to really restrict compilation of the builtins to just clang.  By explicitly indicating that the data is meant to be pushed into the .rodata section via the .section .rodata the assembly is made compatible with clang and gcc (with GAS).  This will enable building these routines on the Linux buildbots via CMake.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@214012 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[UBSan] Call UBSan initialization as early as possible.  Specifically use .preinit_array initialization on Linux and dynamic global initializer on another platforms. Historically UBSan didn't have any initialization code and its runtime was stateless. This is no longer the case - UBSan relies on some non-trivial functionality from sanitizer_common (e.g. online symbolization) and is now configurable by runtime flags. Additionally we've dropped support for enabling UBSan only for a few shared objects so UBSan is now always linked into the main executable so now we can use similar initialization as all the rest sanitizers.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@213983 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[Sanitizer] Introduce SANITIZER_CAN_USE_PREINIT_ARRAY definition and use it across sanitizers.  Get rid of ASAN_USE_PREINIT_ARRAY and LSAN_USE_PREINIT_ARRAY - just always use .preinit_array if it's available. This mode seems stable enough and we've been relying on default values of these macro for a long time.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@213980 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[UBSan] Add the ability to dump call stacks to -fsanitize=vptr  This change introduces the first UBSan-specific runtime flag: print_stacktrace (off by default).

[UBSan] Introduce UBSAN_OPTIONS environment variable.  If UBSan is run in a standalone mode (w/o any other sanitizer) it still uses functions from sanitizer_common some of which depend on the value of runtime flags.

ARM: fix division in some cases  For ARM cores that are ARMv6T2+ but not ARMv7ve or ARMv7-r and not an updated ARMv7-a that has the idiv extension (chips with clz but not idiv) an incorrect jump would be calculated due to the preference to thumb instructions over ARM.  Rather than computing the target at runtime use a jumptable instead.  This trades a bit of storage for performance.  The overhead is 32-bytes for each of the three routines but avoid the calculation of the offset.  Because clz was introduced in ARMv6T2 and idiv in certain versions of ARMv7 the non-clz non-idiv case implies a target which does not support Thumb-2 and thus we cannot use Thumb on those targets (as it is unlikely that the assembly will assemble).  Take the opportunity to refactor the IT block macros into assembly.h rather than redefining them in the TUs where they are used.  Existing tests cover the full change already so no new tests are added.

[ASan] Collect unmangled names of global variables in Clang to print them in error reports.  Currently ASan instrumentation pass creates a string with global name for each instrumented global (to include global names in the error report). Global name is already mangled at this point and we may not be able to demangle it at runtime (e.g. there is no __cxa_demangle on Android).  Instead create a string with fully qualified global name in Clang and pass it to ASan instrumentation pass in llvm.asan.globals metadata. If there is no metadata for some global ASan will use the original algorithm.

MachO: add dummy armv6m architecture directory so clang_macho_embedded builds things.  Without some mention of armv6m in a subdirectory of builtins the make code doesn't even know that armv6m exists and is something it should be looking for in the platform-specific Makefiles. This means that none of the functions listed actually get built and we end up with an almost entirely empty libclang_rt.a for armv6m.  Unfortunately the assembly code in the usual arm directory has no hope of running on armv6m which only supports Thumb-1 (not even ARM mode) so adding it there won't work. Realistically we probably *will* want to put any optimised versions in a separate directory so creating it now is harmless.  rdar://problem/17613576  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@212696 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Generalize sanitizer allocator public interface.  Introduce new public header <sanitizer/allocator_interface.h> and a set of functions __sanitizer_get_ownership() __sanitizer_malloc_hook() etc. that will eventually replace their tool-specific equivalents (__asan_get_ownership() __msan_get_ownership() etc.).

[ASan] Print exact source location of global variables in error reports.  See https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=299 for the original feature request.  Introduce llvm.asan.globals metadata which Clang (or any other frontend) may use to report extra information about global variables to ASan instrumentation pass in the backend. This metadata replaces llvm.asan.dynamically_initialized_globals that was used to detect init-order bugs. llvm.asan.globals contains the following data for each global:   1) source location (file/line/column info);   2) whether it is dynamically initialized;   3) whether it is blacklisted (shouldn't be instrumented).  Source location data is then emitted in the binary and can be picked up by ASan runtime in case it needs to print error report involving some global. For example:    0x... is located 4 bytes to the right of global variable 'C::array' defined in '/path/to/file:17:8' (0x...) of size 40  These source locations are printed even if the binary doesn't have any debug info.  This is an ABI-breaking change. ASan initialization is renamed to __asan_init_v4(). Pre-built libraries compiled with older Clang will not work with the fresh runtime.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@212188 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Fix handling of multiplication by a constant with a number of trailing zeroes.  Multiplication by an integer with a number of trailing zero bits leaves the same number of lower bits of the result initialized to zero. This change makes MSan take this into account in the case of multiplication by a compile-time constant.  We don't handle the general non-constant case because (a) it's not going to be cheap (computation-wise); (b) multiplication by a partially uninitialized value in user code is     a bad idea anyway.  Constant case must be handled because it appears from LLVM optimization of a completely valid user code as the test case in compiler-rt demonstrates.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@211092 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Remove top-level Clang -fsanitize= flags for optional ASan features.  Init-order and use-after-return modes can currently be enabled by runtime flags. use-after-scope mode is not really working at the moment.  The only problem I see is that users won't be able to disable extra instrumentation for init-order and use-after-scope by a top-level Clang flag. But this instrumentation was implicitly enabled for quite a while and we didn't hear from users hurt by it.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@210924 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Add detection of OS X relocatable SDK to compiler-rt as a lit.util function  Clang's lit cfg already detects the currently selected SDK via "xcrun --show-sdk-path". The same thing should be done for compiler-rt tests to make them work on recent OS X versions.

Fix line numbers for code inlined from __nodebug__ functions.  Instructions from __nodebug__ functions don't have file:line information even when inlined into no-nodebug functions. As a result intrinsics (SSE and other) from <*intrin.h> clang headers _never_ have file:line information.

tsan: make positive tests more robust Add a script that is used to deflake inherently flaky tsan tests. It is invoked from lit tests as: %deflake %run %t The script runs the target program up to 10 times until it produces a tsan warning.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@209898 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
tsan: optimize memory access functions The optimization is two-fold: First the algorithm now uses SSE instructions to handle all 4 shadow slots at once. This makes processing faster. Second if shadow contains the same access we do not store the event into trace. This increases effective trace size that is tsan can remember up to 10x more previous memory accesses.  Perofrmance impact: Before: [       OK ] DISABLED_BENCH.Mop8Read (2461 ms) [       OK ] DISABLED_BENCH.Mop8Write (1836 ms) After: [       OK ] DISABLED_BENCH.Mop8Read (1204 ms) [       OK ] DISABLED_BENCH.Mop8Write (976 ms) But this measures only fast-path. On large real applications the speedup is ~20%.  Trace size impact: On app1: Memory accesses                   :       1163265870   Including same                  :        791312905 (68%) on app2: Memory accesses                   :        166875345   Including same                  :        150449689 (90%) 90% of filtered events means that trace size is effectively 10x larger.     git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@209897 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

profile: explicitly initialize file name in the test  The instrprofile-write-file-only test was failing on the builtbots.  The runtime library initialization is explicitly being discarded to avoid the atexit hook. However this would also prevent the filename from being initialized.  Thus when the write file was invoked the filename would not be setup and the test would fail as the profiling data would never be written out.  Explicitly initialize the filename to ensure that the data is written out when requested. This should hopefully finally get the build bots all green again.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@209099 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

InstrProf: Support profiling dlopen'd shared libraries  Shared objects are hard.  After this commit we do the right thing when profiling two separate shared objects that have been dlopen'd with `RTLD_LOCAL` when the main executable is *not* being profiled.  This mainly simplifies the writer logic.    - At initialization determine the output filename and truncate the     file.  Depending on whether shared objects can see each other this     may happen multiple times.    - At exit each executable writes its own profile in append mode.  <rdar://problem/16918688>  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@209053 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

builtins: add missing file  Add (missing) definition of COMPILER_RT_EXPORT which is meant to be used for decorating functions that are meant to be exported.

__clear_cache: decorate with COMPILER_RT_EXPORT  Use COMPILER_RT_EXPORT rather than COMPILER_RT_ABI for this function.

InstrProf: Test the functions in the runtime  Check that the profile runtime works as expected.  This tests the functions that are meant to be available to advanced users.  In particular check that the `atexit()` hook can be disabled by defining a custom `__llvm_profile_runtime` variable that the libc dependencies are optional and that the various functions for writing out files work for basic cases.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@208460 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[CMake] Use ExternalProject to build MSan-ified version of libcxx for unit tests.  This change lets MSan rely on libcxx's own build system instead of manually compiling its sources and setting up all the necessary compile flags. It would also simplify compiling libcxx with another sanitizers (in particular TSan).  The tricky part is to make sure libcxx is reconfigured/rebuilt when Clang or MSan runtime library is changed. "clobber" step used in this patch works well for me but it's possible it would break for other configurations - will watch the buildbots.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@208451 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Fix coverage behavior when a PC belongs to an unknown address range.  This happens e.g. when coverage data is collected for a module which is then dlclose()'d. Currently this causes CovDump() to ignore all PCs that are greater than the unrecognized PC. In other words unloading a module causes ASan to silently ignore any coverage data for modules loaded at higher addresses. Instead we should just skip the unrecognized PCs.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@208333 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

The solution has been proposed by tahabekireren@gmail.com in https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=210 This is also known to fix some Chromium iOS tests.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@207002 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[msan] Disable chained origins in signal handlers.  StackDepot is not async-signal-safe; storing a new origin to it can deadlock.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206983 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] disable lsan back. :(  -- It appears that quite a few lit tests have leaks and they were not covered by out buildbot  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206955 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
tsan: more precise check for "app memory" in COMPAT mode this fires when a user makes mmap with fixed address (see the test)    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206952 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] enable LeakSanitizer (LSan) by default in asan. This only affects Linux x86_64. LSan has been used in various projects for more than half a year and we now consider it quite stable to be on by default.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206896 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] add one more mode to run asan tests with '-with-calls' i.e. using  -mllvm -asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold=0. This is very unfortunate since it effectively doubles the number of gunit asan tests that need to be built and run but as long as we need out-lined calls (PR17409) I see no other way to test this workaround  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206742 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Change AddressSanitizer.LoadStoreCallbacks to use asan_malloc and asan_free. Interceptors don't really work on OSX in asan_noinst_test.cc (this is more or less intentional) so one shouldn't call intercepted functions in this test -- added a comment about this.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206477 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] add __asan_load1/__asan_store1/... callbacks to asan-rt; together with -mllvm -asan-instrumentation-with-call-threshold=N this will be a workaround for PR17409  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@206387 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[TSan] Fix a rare deadlock on multithreaded fork.  If a multi-threaded program calls fork() TSan ignores all memory accesses in the child to prevent deadlocks in TSan runtime. This is OK as child is probably going to call exec() as soon as possible. However a rare deadlocks could be caused by ThreadIgnoreBegin() function itself.  ThreadIgnoreBegin() remembers the current stack trace and puts it into the StackDepot to report a warning later if a thread exited with ignores enabled. Using StackDepotPut in a child process is dangerous: it locks a mutex on a slow path which could be already locked in a parent process.  The fix is simple: just don't put current stack traces to StackDepot in ThreadIgnoreBegin() and ThreadIgnoreSyncBegin() functions if we're running after a multithreaded fork. We will not report any "thread exited with ignores enabled" errors in this case anyway.  Submitting this without a testcase as I believe the standalone reproducer is pretty hard to construct.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@205534 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Avoid aliases to weak aliases in interceptors.  The interceptors had code that after macro expansion ended up looking like  extern "C" void memalign()     __attribute__((weak alias("__interceptor_memalign"))); extern "C" void __interceptor_memalign() {} extern "C" void __interceptor___libc_memalign()     __attribute__((alias("memalign")));  That is * __interceptor_memalign is a function * memalign is a weak alias to __interceptor_memalign * __interceptor___libc_memalign is an alias to memalign  Both gcc and clang produce assembly that look like  __interceptor_memalign: ...         .weak   memalign memalign = __interceptor_memalign         .globl  __interceptor___libc_memalign __interceptor___libc_memalign = memalign  What it means in the end is that we have 3 symbols pointing to the same position in the file one of which is weak:       8: 0000000000000000     1 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 __interceptor_memalign      9: 0000000000000000     1 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT    1 memalign     10: 0000000000000000     1 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT    1 __interceptor___libc_memalign  In particular note that __interceptor___libc_memalign will always point to __interceptor_memalign even if we do link in a strong symbol for memalign. In fact the above code produces exactly the same binary as  extern "C" void memalign()     __attribute__((weak alias("__interceptor_memalign"))); extern "C" void __interceptor_memalign() {} extern "C" void __interceptor___libc_memalign()     __attribute__((alias("__interceptor_memalign")));  If nothing else this patch makes it more obvious what is going on.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@204823 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

InstrProf: If libc is available use it; no functionality change  It was misguided to plan to rely on __llvm_profile_write_buffer() in __llvm_profile_write_file().  It's less complex to duplicate the writing logic than to mmap the file.

PGO: Add explicit static initialization  Instead of relying on explicit static initialization from translation units create a new file InstrProfilingRuntime.cc with an __llvm_pgo_runtime variable.  After this commit (and its pair in clang) the driver will create a use of this variable.  Unless the user defines their own version the new object file will get pulled in including that C++ static initialization that calls __llvm_pgo_register_write_atexit.  The result is that at least on Darwin static initialization typically consists of a single function call which registers a writeout functino atexit.  Furthermore users can skip even this behaviour by defining their own __llvm_pgo_runtime.  <rdar://problem/15943240>  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@204380 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

PGO: Statically generate data structures  In instrumentation-based profiling we need a set of data structures to represent the counters.  Previously these were built up during static initialization.  Now they're shoved into a specially-named section so that they show up as an array.  As a consequence of the reorganizing symbols instrumentation data structures for linkonce functions are now correctly coalesced.  This is the first step in a larger project to minimize runtime overhead and dependencies in instrumentation-based profilng.  The larger picture includes removing all initialization overhead and making the dependency on libc optional.  <rdar://problem/15943240>  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@204079 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan: yet another attempt to fix pthread_cond interceptors Make behavior introduced in r202820 conditional (under legacy_pthread_cond flag).

[CMake] Port add_sanitizer_rt_symbols to CMake 3.0  Patch by Brad King.  Our add_sanitizer_rt_symbols macro reads the LOCATION property of a library to compute the location of the "lib<name>.a.syms" file to generate next to the corresponding "lib<name>.a" library file.  CMake 3.0 introduces policy CMP0026 to disallow reading of the LOCATION target property from non-imported targets in favor of the more powerful $<TARGET_FILE> generator expression.  Teach add_sanitizer_rt_symbols to use the $<TARGET_FILE> generator expression to compute the location of the symbols file to generate with a custom command.  CMake 3.0 also adds support for generator expressions to install(FILES) so use it when available to simplify installation of the symbols file of the proper configuration.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@202797 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[CMake] Fix add_sanitizer_rt_symbols on multi-config CMake generators.  Patch by Brad King.  When using a multi-config generator with CMake such as for VS or Xcode the LOCATION target property value contains a placeholder such as "$(Configuration)" that is meant for substitution by the native build tool. The install(FILES) command does not understand this name and will not install the symbols file correctly when using these generators.  Teach add_sanitizer_rt_symbols to read the more-specific target property LOCATION_<CONFIG> that has a per-configuration value and no placeholder. On single-configuration generators (Makefile Ninja) CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE contains the name of the one configuration to be built.  On multi-config generators (VS Xcode) CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES contains the list of possible configurations.  In the latter case loop over the configs and add a configuration-specific install(FILES) rule for each one.  Place the code block inside an if(TRUE) block so it can be made conditional in a following change without updating indentation.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@202796 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] Install asan_device_setup to bin/ when targetting Android.  asan_device_setup is a utility that prepares a device to run code built with ASan.

Darwin: use the compiler-provided linker  When actually compiling we use clang for the final .dylib creation stage so we should ask it what linker it'll use when detecting support for our architectures.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201845 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] Do all calls to __asan_report_* through PLT.  This matters when runtime is built as a shared library. Even though calling code is itself part of the same library these symbols are public and can (theoretically) be interposed.  It might be better to declare hidden aliases for asan_report_* and call them directly but   (a) they are (noreturn) so performance does not matter and   (b) it may be potentially less portable.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201764 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] A different way of detectinb stack overflow.  Instead of checking stack limits that are not well defined for the main thread we rely on siginfo::si_code and distance from SP.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201673 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[CMake] Add the way to run tests in standalone build.  1) Depend on llvm-config (configured in LLVM_CONFIG_PATH) to get necessary LLVM source/binary directories. 2) Add basic support for running lit tests (check-xsan commands). For now this "support" is far from what we want:   * unit tests are not built currently.   * lit tests use Clang/compiler-rt from LLVM build directory     not the host compiler or just-built compiler-rt libraries.  We should make a choice on the way we intend ti run compiler-rt lit testsuite: a) use either Clang from LLVM build tree or the host compiler. b) use either just-built runtimes or the runtimes shipped with the host compiler.  Using just-built runtimes is tricky - we have to know where to put them so that Clang/GCC driver would pick them up (and not overwrite the existing runtimes). Using a host compiler instead of Clang from LLVM build tree will give us a chance to run lit tests under GCC (which already has support for several sanitizers).  That is I tend to make the following choice: if we're in a standalone compiler-rt build use host compiler with its set of runtime libraries to run lit tests. This will effectively decouple "make compiler-rt" and "make check-compiler-rt" in a standalone build - the latter wouldn't invoke the former. Note that if we decide to fix LLVM/Clang/compiler-rt build system so that it would configure/build compiler-rt with just-built Clang (as we do in Makefile-based build) this will not be a problem - we can add a dependency to ensure that clang/compiler-rt are rebuilt before running compiler-rt tests.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201656 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer] Use mmap to zero-fill large shadow regions.  This is covered by existing ASan test. This does not change anything for TSan by default (but provides a flag to  change the threshold size). Based on a patch by florent.bruneau here:   https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=256    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201400 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] Android test runner for ASan lit tests.  This change replaces 32- and 64- bit config.in-s with a single config template that is used to generate both 32 and 64 bits configs as well as the new arm-android config. Arm-android config is special because it can run tests on a remote device over adb (android debug bridge).   We replace %clang with a script that run the compiler upload the result to the device and replaces it with another script. The second script runs the binary on the device and delivers stdout/stderr/exitcode back.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201394 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer] Fix off-by-one-line in SEGV reports on Android.  This will be covered by null_deref.cc test (requires one more fix to pass).   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201325 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[asan] Fix null_deref test with zero base shadow.  With zero base shadow shadow for near-zero access is itself at near-zero location. As a result this test crashes on the shadow access and not on the app access.  Relax a check to match this behavior.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201324 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Remove a check from strerror_r test.  It's not always true: on Android strerror_r with invalid errno prints "Unknown error ..." to the buffer and returns 0.  This test now only checks that strerror_r does not crash.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201321 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer] Use system unwinder in signal handlers on Android.  Because of the way Bionic sets up signal stack frames libc unwinder is unable to step through it resulting in broken SEGV stack traces.  Luckily libcorkscrew.so on Android implements an unwinder that can start with a signal context thus sidestepping the issue.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@201151 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

CMake: Enable -Werror for the -fno-function-sections check  If the -fno-function-sections flag isn't recognized the compiler emits a warning.

[ASan] Replace the call to "vname" with "WRAP(vname)" in FORMAT_INTERCEPTOR_IMPL It's incorrect to call the function by its name in the interceptor because that means WRAP(vname) on Linux and REAL(vname) on OSX.

tsan: relax check for errno spoiling more  We do not detect errno spoiling for SIGTERM because some SIGTERM handlers do spoil errno but reraise SIGTERM tsan reports false positive in such case. It's difficult to properly detect this situation (reraise) because in async signal processing case (when handler is called directly from rtl_generic_sighandler) we have not yet received the reraised signal; and it looks too fragile to intercept all ways to reraise a signal.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@200742 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Enable compilation of RT on ARM  Adding the ARM RT sources to the CMake files and enabling some sanitizers to also build on ARM.

[ASan] Reinstate ASAN_LOW_MEMORY which has nothing to do with signal handling and thus should not be moved to common.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@200319 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Rewrite strto* interceptors and add a few more.  Express the strto* interceptors though macros. This removes a lot of duplicate code and fixes a couple of copypasto bugs (where "res" was declared of a different type than the actual return type). Also add a few more interceptors for strto*_l.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@200316 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer] revert r200197: the buggy kernel (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67651) is almost unusable with asan even with this workaround (too slow) so this workaround makes no sense.

ARM: remove unnecessary .arm directive  It was redundant (since ARM mode is the default) and misleading since (e.g.) Cortex-A15 would not satisfy the #ifdef but would be in ARM mode regardless.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@200043 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan: do not deadlock on fork  Currently correct programs can deadlock after fork because atomic operations and async-signal-safe calls are not async-signal-safe under tsan. With this change: - if a single-threaded program forks the child continues running with verification enabled (the tsan background thread is recreated as well) - if a multi-threaded program forks then the child runs with verification disabled (memory accesses atomic operations and interceptors are disabled); it's expected that it will exec soon anyway - if the child tries to create more threads after multi-threaded fork the program aborts with error message - die_after_fork flag is added that allows to continue running but all bets are off  http://llvm-reviews.chandlerc.com/D2614     git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@199993 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Macho-embedded: update build script for newer Clang behaviour.      Clang now uses the *-apple-macho triples for embedded targets using MachO. The environment makes less pretences to be running an actual Mach kernel with all the support that would imply so a few changes are needed to the build scripts:      + The Apple way of detecting endianness applies in all cases so drop the   __MACH__ test. + A quick rename since "darwin_embedded" no longer makes any sense. If there's   no Mach going on there's certainly no Darwin. + Change how we test for support for a platform. The functions we build don't   need any SDK support (stdio.h ...) so we don't need to check for it.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@199731 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] extend asan-coverage (still experimental).  - add a mode for collecting per-block coverage (-asan-coverage=2).    So far the implementation is naive (all blocks are instrumented)    the performance overhead on top of asan could be as high as 30%.  - Make sure the one-time calls to __sanitizer_cov are moved to function buttom    which in turn required to copy the original debug info into the call insn.

[Sanitizer] Add basic support for using libbacktrace in symbolizer.  This change allows to compile sanitizer sources so that *san runtime will attempt to use libbacktrace and/or libiberty for symbolization (instead of communicating with llvm-symbolizer).

Use the PRIu64 macro for printing a uint64_t.  Otherwise on (some) 64-bit systems -Wformat will trigger a warning because uint64_t is an 'unsigned long' not an 'unsigned long long'.

Fix an ODR violation in the sanitizer runtimes.  A helper function is a C++ function and so even though one of the two definitions is weak it still technically triggers the ODR. Perhaps these two definitions are ODR equivalent but I'm not even confident in that.  Instead just define the function once declare it as weak and use a wrapper that is clearly file-local. This avoids two definitions. Also make the function extern "C" so that we can't even mess up the type signature somehow or otherwise fail to match up the weak declaration here with the interceptor defined elsewhere.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@198253 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Fix the test for __asan_gen_ globals and actually fix http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17976 by setting the correct linkage (as stated in the bug).   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@198018 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[ASan] Make sure none of the __asan_gen_ global strings end up in the symbol table add a test.

tsan: fix false positive in pthread stack manupulation pthread uses internal cache we do not see synchronization in it    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197982 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
tsan: remove in_rtl counter  This is intended to address the following problem. Episodically we see CHECK-failures when recursive interceptors call back into user code. Effectively we are not "in_rtl" at this point but it's very complicated and fragile to properly maintain in_rtl property. Instead get rid of it. It was used mostly for sanity CHECKs which basically never uncover real problems. Instead introduce ignore_interceptors flag which is used in very few narrow places to disable recursive interceptors (e.g. during runtime initialization).    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197979 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[lsan] Make the report_objects flag more useful.  Print the list of leaked objects after each leak report. Previously we printed only a joint list of all leaked objects. As a bonus suppressed objects are no longer reported.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197977 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[DFSan] New custom wrappers  Added the following custom wrappers:   strstr   strrchr   memchr   nanosleep   socketpair  Tweaked a couple of existing wrappers: if a wrapper returns a pointers derived from an input pointer then return the label of the input pointer  Sorted tests invocation  Differential Revision: D2354  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197601 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Disable DynamoRio detection.  This code is not robust enough and triggers when simply linking with libdynamorio.so without any code translation at all. Disabling it is safe (i.e. we may unpoison too much memory and see false negatives but never false positives).   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197568 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[lsan] Remove the LSan-specific verbosity flag.  It conflicted with the verbosity flag we had in common flags. We don't need an LSan-specific flag anyway.  Also shift some logging levels and remove some unnecessary code.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197512 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[lsan] Introduce print_suppressions flag.  Introduce a flag to either always or never print matched suppressions. Previously matched suppressions were printed unconditionally if there were unsuppressed leaks. Also verbosity=1 no longer has the semantics of "always print suppressions and summary".  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197510 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[Sanitizer] Always initialize a Symbolizer (even if 'symbolize' is false).  If 'symbolize' flag is not set we still want to transform virtual address to module+offset pair in the call to Symbolizer::SymbolizeCode(). See https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=251 for more details.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197491 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[lsan] Introduce __lsan_(un)register_root_region().  Add an interface for telling LSan that a region of memory is to be treated as a source of live pointers. Useful for code which stores pointers in mapped memory.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197489 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[msan] Tweak gethostbyname_r interceptor some more.  This is covered by msan_test depending on glibc version and/or resolver setup.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197484 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[msan] Relax gethostbyname_r test condition.  Apparently its return value depends on the glibc version.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197390 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[msan] Fix gethostbyname_r and similar interceptors.  *h_errno is written not on success but on failure. In fact it seems like it can be written even when return value signals success so we just unpoison it in all cases.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@197383 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Only build embedded darwin variants if the compiler supports them  We need to filter out architectures that the compiler hasn't been built to target (most likely the ARM ones) before attemptint to build a version of libcompiler_rt.

[ASan] Don't call __asan_init() from certain interceptors on Darwin.  Fixes http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58994 which hadn't manifested in LLVM because libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib used to depend on the Foundation framework. Without that dependency some interceptors may be called from the system libraries before libSystem_initializer() is called which lead to assertion failures in sanitizer_mac.cc (_NSGetEnviron() returns NULL).  To fix the problem we fall back to the original functions in the common libsanitizer interceptors and the __cxa_atexit() interceptor on Darwin.  This patch also prints a better error message in the case _NSGetEnviron() returns NULL.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@194573 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Add CMake configs for libclang_rt.asan_iossim_dynamic.dylib   CMake changes to build the ASan runtime for the iOS simulator. This is a universal library targeting the same architectures as the OSX ASan runtime does thus the iossim version can't live in the same universal libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib  The difference between the OSX and iossim builds is in the -mios-simulator-version-min and -ios_simulator_version_min flags that tell Clang to compile and link iossim code.  The iossim runtime can only be built on a machine with both Xcode and the iOS Simulator SDK installed.

[Sanitizer] Add Symbolizer::AddHooks() and use it in TSan and MSan.  Summary: TSan and MSan need to know if interceptor was called by the user code or by the symbolizer and use pre- and post-symbolization hooks for that. Make Symbolizer class responsible for calling these hooks instead. This would ensure the hooks are only called when necessary (during in-process symbolization they are not needed for out-of-process) and save specific sanitizers from tracing all places in the code where symbolization will be performed.

Overhaul the symbolizer interface.  This moves away from creating the symbolizer object and initializing the external symbolizer as separate steps.  Those steps now always take place together.  Sanitizers with a legacy requirement to specify their own symbolizer path should use InitSymbolizer to initialize the symbolizer with the desired path and GetSymbolizer to access the symbolizer.  Sanitizers with no such requirement (e.g. UBSan) can use GetOrInitSymbolizer with no need for initialization.  The symbolizer interface has been made thread-safe (as far as I can tell) by protecting its member functions with mutexes.  Finally the symbolizer interface no longer relies on weak externals the introduction of which was probably a mistake on my part.

tsan: ignore interceptors coming from specified libraries  LibIgnore allows to ignore all interceptors called from a particular set of dynamic libraries. LibIgnore remembers all "called_from_lib" suppressions from the provided SuppressionContext; finds code ranges for the libraries; and checks whether the provided PC value belongs to the code ranges.

[ASan] Enforce the memmove semantics for both memcpy() and memmove() interceptors on Darwin.  Due to bugs in the interposition of resolver functions on 10.7 and 10.8 both memcpy() and memmove() were previously intercepted by INTERCEPTOR(memcpy) which led to false positives and crashes (see http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16362) We choose to use a memmove-like function in both cases. This effectively disables the overlap checks in memcpy() but the overlaps aren't possible in practice because memcpy() and memmove() are the same function on Darwin.  Once the interposition is fixed in 10.9 we'll need to revisit this issue see https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=226   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@191081 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[sanitizer] Split platform_limits_posix into system- and kernel-dependent parts.  This change moves everything depending on kernel headers (mostly ioctl types and ids) into a separate source file. This will reduce the possibility of header conflict on various platforms (most importantly older glibc versions).  This change also removes 2 deprecated ioctls and symbolic ids for other bunch of ambiguous ioctls (i.e. same id is shared by ioctls with different memory behavior).   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@188369 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

DataFlowSanitizer; compiler-rt changes.  DataFlowSanitizer is a generalised dynamic data flow analysis.  Unlike other Sanitizer tools this tool is not designed to detect a specific class of bugs on its own.

[TSan] Fix free_race.c by removing `not` from the test invocation that doesn't fail.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@187889 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[TSan] Let the users suppress use-after-free errors using the "race:" suppressions.  If there's a race between a memory access and a free() call in the client program it can be reported as a use-after-free (if the access occurs after the free()) or an ordinary race (if free() occurs after the access). We've decided to use a single "race:" prefix for both cases instead of introducing a "use-after-free:" one because in many cases this allows us to keep a single suppression for both the use-after-free and free-after-use.  This may be misleading if the use-after-free occurs in a non-racy way (e.g. in a single-threaded program). But normally such bugs shall not be suppressed.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@187885 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Revert "[sanitizer] Intercept sched_getaffinity."  This reverts commit r187788.  The test case is unreliable (as the test may be run in a situation in which it has no affinity with cpu0).

Fix a veritable conucopia of bugs in the readdir_r interceptors.  First the reason I came here: I forgot to look at readdir64_r which had the exact same bug as readdir_r. However upon applying the same quick-fix and testing it I discovered that it still didn't work at all. As a consequence I spent some time studying the code and thinking about it and fixed several other problems.  Second the code was checking for a null entry and result pointer but there is no indication that null pointers are viable here. Certainly the spec makes it extremely clear that there is no non-error case where the implementation of readdir_r fails to dereference the 'result' pointer and store NULL to it. Thus our checking for a non-null 'result' pointer before reflecting that write in the instrumentation was trivially dead. Remove it.  Third the interceptor was marking the write to the actual dirent struct by looking at the entry pointer but nothing in the spec requires that the dirent struct written is actually written into the entry structure provided. A threadlocal buffer would be just as conforming and the spec goes out of its way to say the pointer to the *actual* result dirent struct is stored into *result so *that* is where the interceptor should reflect a write occuring. This also obviates the need to even consider whether the 'entry' parameter is null.  Fourth I got to the bottom of why nothing at all worked in readdir64_r -- the interceptor structure for dirent64 was completely wrong in that it was the same as dirent. I fixed this struct to be correct (64-bit inode and 64-bit offset! just a 64-bit offset isn't enough!) and added several missing tests for the size and layout of this struct.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@186109 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Fix a bug in the readdir_r interceptor: when we reach the end of the directory stream the entry is not written to instead *result is set to NULL and the entry is not written to at all.  I'm still somewhat suspicious of the correct instrumention here -- I feel like it should be marking the written range as the pointer in *result and the length (*result)->d_reclen in case the implementation decides not to use the passed-in entry (if that's even allowed). Finally the definition of 'struct dirent' analog used in the interceptor is wrong in 32-bit mode with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 as it hard codes the use of a pointer-sized offset.  I've added a somewhat goofy test for the bug I fixed via ASan -- suggestions on how to better test the interceptor logic itself welcome.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@185998 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Revert the Darwin half of r184805: "Remove the sysroot (or isysroot) restriction from the GCDAProfile.c"  Bill added a much more effective way of coping with the use of errno and other system interactions for Darwin for now by disabling it on that platform.

Temporarily disable building the armv7 variants of profile_ios on darwin.  After talking with Jim Grosbach pretty extensively he was OK with me punting on this to the Apple folks.  We agreed that the correct fix is either to extend the fake SDK headers in compiler-rt to support the rest of libc needed by GCDAProfiling.c or to teach the make build to test for the existence of a suitable SDK on the system prior to building it. Both of these require someone with access to the SDK which I don't have and the latter (my preferred solution) requires understanding the strange compiler-rt make build system. Punting to Dan Dunbar or one of the others who support this stuff on ios to write the appropriate fix and we can let the build bots proceed in the mean time.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@184816 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Remove the sysroot (or isysroot) restriction from the GCDAProfile.c runtime in the Makefile build system as well. Sorry for the temporary fallout it took me a while to find these bits.  Bill I'm not at all confident of the change for Darwin and iOS but as discussed we're completely blocked on fixing this. Anyways please review and let me know if this will work for you guys. If necessary I can work with you to rig up an errno.h stub for Darwin but I expect that to be... moderately challenging.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@184805 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Address a few of the issues in GCDAProfiling I noted when looking through Bill's patch:  1) Correctly test the file descriptor after the sceond attempt at    creating the file. 2) Make the filename a global so that we can issue error messages from    other routines. 3) Check errno in several places and print it out so that errors are    easier to track down.  I don't really expect any of these to fix the current failures I'm seeing but I'm hopeful they'll at least let me debug them.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@184799 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Remove the sysroot restriction from building GCDAProfiling.c.  We really need the C standard library to be available to implement the profiling runtime library reasonably and replicating everything in the SDKs tree really isn't addressing any problems we have. Notably all of the sanitizer runtimes take the same approach and this isn't a library which could end up in a bootstrapping problem where the system headers aren't even available.  This will hopefully prevent subsequent changes which start using various other bits of C standard library to make things more debuggable.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@184798 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Call __asan_free_hook() before marking the chunk quarantinned  Summary: With this change the user may safely call __asan_get_ownership() from malloc/free hooks and assume it would return "true". If there is a realloc/free race free hook might be called twice but I think it's acceptable as it's a data race and would later be reported anyway.  This change also fixes a bug when failing realloc incorrectly marked the original memory as "quarantinned".

[msan] Handle mixed track-origins and keep-going settings (compiler-rt part).  Before this change each module defined a weak_odr global __msan_track_origins with a value of 1 if origin tracking is enabled 0 if disabled.

[ASan] Rename __asan_preinit to __local_asan_preinit to avoid warnings from the linker which is trying to export all the __asan_* symbols   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@182567 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Performance improvement.  Using fwrite and fread was very *very* slow. The resulting code was multiple times slower than GCC's implementation of gcov. Replace the fwrite/fread system with an mmap() version.  If the `.gcda' file doesn't exist we (re)allocate a buffer that we write into. That gets written to the `.gcda' file in one chunk. If the `.gcda' file already exists we simply mmap() the file modify the mapped data and use msync() to write the contents out to disk. It's much easier than implementing our own buffering scheme and we don't have to use fwrite's and fread's buffering.  For those who are numbers-oriented here are some timings:  GCC Verison -----------  `.gcda' files don't exist:  23s `.gcda' files do exist:     14s  LLVM Version (before this change) ---------------------------------  `.gcda' files don't exist:  28s `.gcda' files do exist:     28s  LLVM Version (with this change) -------------------------------  `.gcda' files don't exist:  18s `.gcda' files do exist:      4s  It's a win-win-win-win-lose-win-win scenario!  <rdar://problem/13466086>   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@182563 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[nolibc] Change internal syscall API to remove reliance on libc's errno.  This change moves to a model where the error value of a system call is potentially contained in the return value itself rather than being implicit in errno.  The helper function internal_iserror can be used to extract the error value from a return value.  On platforms other than Linux/x86_64 this still uses errno but other platforms are free to port their error handling to this new model.

[nolibc] Disable the GCC stack protector when building sanitizer runtimes.  This is the first in a sequence of changes designed to eliminate the libc dependency in sanitizer_common.  The main motivation for these changes is to be able to provide an alternative for the current interceptor-based technique for instrumenting functions in libc. In this new technique we compile libc with instrumentation.  This has the potential advantages of being more accurate than interception and reducing the amount of custom code required for each libc function. As a side effect of this we cannot depend on libc in the sanitizer runtime due to mutual dependency issues.  This change disables the GCC stack protector which introduces a libc dependency and is enabled by default in Ubuntu.

[sanitizer] Move GetThreadStackAndTls from TSan to sanitizer_common.  Move this function to sanitizer_common because LSan uses it too. Also fix a bug where the TLS range reported for main thread was off by the size of the thread descriptor from libc (TSan doesn't care much but for LSan it's critical).  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@181322 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[sanitizer] Sanitizer __internal_*stat interface.  With this change __internal_*stat always expect a "struct stat *" argument. This avoids stat/stat64 caller-side confusion (sanitizer_common tests already made this mistake) and allows the use of __internal_fstat() as a drop-in replacement for libc's fstat().   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@181311 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Rewrite sw_vers makefile check to avoid error message on Linux.  When building compiler-rt on Linux the "which sw_vers" check fails and writes an error message into the build log. Apparently on Solaris "which" writes the error message to stdout so that the current test won't even work properly. As far as I know sw_vers always lives in /usr/bin so just check for it there instead of using "which".  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@180792 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[libsanitizer] Run the callback on a separate stack in StopTheWorld.  Currently the callback runs on the caller's stack. If this stack contains values that have gone out of scope and we are not super careful those values can propagate into global variables (the libc sigaction() in particular has a side effect that can lead to this). This has caused false negatives in leak checking code.  Changes: map a separate stack space for the tracer thread. Also move some globals into local scope (they had no business being global anyway).

Change the cmake variable COMPILER_RT_CAN_EXECUTE_TESTS to be an option so that it can overwritten.  The reason why this simple change is needed is that I am trying to set up a quick cmake/ninja based buildbot and apple-clang does not support using the sanitizers currently.  The default behavior follows exactly what was there before implying that no ones builds should be affected at all.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@178455 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] Change the way we report the alloca frame on stack-buff-overflow.  Before: the function name was stored by the compiler as a constant string and the run-time was printing it. Now: the PC is stored instead and the run-time prints the full symbolized frame. This adds a couple of instructions into every function with non-empty stack frame but also reduces the binary size because we store less strings (I saw 2% size reduction). This change bumps the asan ABI version to v3.  compiler-rt part llvm part will follow.

[ASan] Fix an error on invalid deallocation in ASan allocator. When ASan checks if memory freed by user was indeed previously allocated it first does an atomic write to presumed location of chunk header.

Split ubsan runtime into three pieces (compiler-rt part):  * libclang_rt-san-* is sanitizer_common and is linked in only if no other    sanitizer runtime is present.  * libclang_rt-ubsan-* is the piece of the runtime which doesn't depend on    a C++ ABI library and is always linked in.  * libclang_rt-ubsan_cxx-* is the piece of the runtime which depends on a    C++ ABI library and is only linked in when linking a C++ binary.  The Darwin ubsan runtime is unchanged.

Create a coverage initialization function.  This function replaces the call of `atexit' from being generated in the compile units. Basically it registers the "writeout" and "flush" functions (if present). It will generate calls to the `atexit' function for cleanups and final writeout functions but only once. This is better than checking for `main' because a library may not have a `main' function in it. <rdar://problem/12439551>   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@177578 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Add a way to register and execute "writeout" functions.  It may be prohibitively expensive to write out >1000 files at the same time. So we would rather emit them serially.

Add some GCOV functions that register all of the __llvm_gcov_flush() functions.  The __llvm_gcov_flush() functions only work for the local compile unit. However when __gcov_flush() is called the user expects all of the counters to be flushed not just the ones in the current compile unit.  This adds some library functions that register the flush functions. It also defined __gcov_flush() so that loops through that list and calls the functions.

[msan] intercept dlopen and clear shadow for it  Summary: The loader does not call mmap() through the PLT because it has to bootstrap the process before libc is present.  Hooking dlopen() isn't enough either because the loader runs module initializers before returning and they could run arbitrary msan instrumented code.  If msandr is present then we can intercept the mmaps from dlopen at the syscall layer and clear the shadow there.  If msandr is missing we clear the shadow after dlopen() and hope any initializers are trivial.

[ASan] Fix https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=159 MaybeReexec() does now a tricky job to manage DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES in a safe way.  Because we're using library interposition it's critical for an instrumented app to be executed with the runtime library present in DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES list. Therefore if it's initially missing in that list we append the runtime library name to the value of DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES and then exec() ourselves.  On the other hand some of the apps exec()ed by our program may not want to have ASan runtime library preloaded so we remove the runtime library from the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES if it's already there.  Users may want to preload other libraries using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES so we preserve those.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@175276 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[asan] make asan work with 7fff8000 offset and prelink  When prelink is installed in the system prelink-ed libraries map between 0x003000000000 and 0x004000000000 thus occupying the shadow Gap so we need so split the address space even further like this: || [0x10007fff8000 0x7fffffffffff] || HighMem    || || [0x02008fff7000 0x10007fff7fff] || HighShadow || || [0x004000000000 0x02008fff6fff] || ShadowGap3 || || [0x003000000000 0x003fffffffff] || MidMem     || || [0x00087fff8000 0x002fffffffff] || ShadowGap2 || || [0x00067fff8000 0x00087fff7fff] || MidShadow  || || [0x00008fff7000 0x00067fff7fff] || ShadowGap  || || [0x00007fff8000 0x00008fff6fff] || LowShadow  || || [0x000000000000 0x00007fff7fff] || LowMem     ||  Do it only if necessary.  Also added a bit of profiling code to make sure that the mapping code is efficient.  Added a lit test to simulate prelink-ed libraries. Unfortunately this test does not work with binutils-gold linker. If gold is the default linker the test silently passes.  Also replaced __has_feature(address_sanitizer) with __has_feature(address_sanitizer) || defined(__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__) in two places.

[sanitizer] Improve scanf interceptor  This a rewrite of the scanf parser. The new implementation is pretty close to the spec with a few shortcuts taken here and there. It is conservative i.e. it gives up parsing if it does not understand some part of the format string or runs into an ambiguous % spec. It does not handle some rarely used parts of the spec like %n$ - for now.  I'm also moving parser call to after the original *scanf function completes so that we can find out the store size of %s directive by the use of strlen() on the target buffer.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@174704 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] Use dylib interposition to hook memory allocation in the dynamic runtime. This CL drastically simplifies the way we're hooking the memory allocation routines in ASan on Mac by using dylib interposition to replace the main malloc_zone_* functions. This allows us to avoid replacing the default CFAllocator and drop the CF dependency at all.  Committing this patch will result in the static runtime being broken. A follow-up CL will switch ASan to use the dynamic runtime library.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@173134 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Significantly change the way we build ASan unittests in CMake build tree. Now just-built Clang is used to:   1) compile instrumented sources (as before);   2) compile non-instrumented sources;   3) compile our own instrumented version of googletest;   4) link it all together using -fsanitize=address flag      (instead of trying to copy linker behavior in       CMake build rules).  This makes ASan unittests pretty much self-consistent and independent of other LLVM libraries.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@170541 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

ubsan: Add -fsanitize=bool and -fsanitize=enum which check for loads of bit-patterns which are not valid values for enumerated or boolean types. These checks are the ubsan analogue of !range metadata.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@170107 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[sanitizer] replace size_t with SIZE_T in interceptors (same for ssize_t off_t and off64_t).

[sanitizer] change the way SizeClassAllocator64 allocated memory from the system: instead of one huge mmap(NORESERVE) it does one huge mprotect and then does small on-demand mmaps. This allows us to call OnMap callbacks which are required to poison newly allocated memory in asan  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@170097 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Add caching to the MemoryMappingLayout class on Linux. This is necessary for the cases when a sandbox prevents ASan from reading the mappings from /proc/self/maps.

Revert r163411 based on review discussion.  In code review it looked like these warnings do not actually fire with modern Clang or GCC.

[asan] fix asan's Makefile.old -- our build bot still uses it (hopefully will soon migrate to cmake completely)  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@162831 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Relocate the external headers provided by ASan and the common sanitizer library.  These headers are intended to be available to user code when built with AddressSanitizer (or one of the other sanitizer's in the future) to interface with the runtime library. As such they form stable external C interfaces and the headers shouldn't be located within the implementation.  I've pulled them out into what seem like fairly obvious locations and names but I'm wide open to further bikeshedding of these names and locations.  I've updated the code and the build system to cope with the new locations both CMake and Makefile. Please let me know if this breaks anyone's build.  The eventual goal is to install these headers along side the Clang builtin headers when we build the ASan runtime and install it. My current thinking is to locate them at:    <prefix>/lib/clang/X.Y/include/sanitizer/common_interface_defs.h   <prefix>/lib/clang/X.Y/include/sanitizer/asan_interface.h   <prefix>/lib/clang/X.Y/include/sanitizer/...  But maybe others have different suggestions?  Fixing the style of the #include between these headers at least unblocks experimentation with installing them as they now should work when installed in these locations.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@162822 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Some flag cleanup for the sanitizer runtimes.  This hoists most of the CFLAGS into a common variable. It also adds detection for -Wno-c99-extensions and uses it to silence a pile of warnings.  Finally it switches to the proper flag -rdynamic.  With this the cmake build is warning free on my bootstrap Linux build.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@162809 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Re-implement the wrappers for libdispatch functions using blocks where appropriate (kudos to Anna Zaks for a good example).

[ASan] Create new files asan_report.{hcc} as a preparation for refactoring of ASan error reporting code. Currently ASan reports many kinds of errors and the code that actually prints error messages can be found inside allocator OS-specific files interceptors code etc.  An example of maintenance troubles this situation causes: There is currently an ASan interface function that registers callback which should take the char buffer with error report printed by ASan. This function is now broken as one has to insert callback calls to all the places in ASan code where the error reports are printed surprisingly it is not only "__asan_report_error" function...   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@161568 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

First tiny move towards integrating AddressSanitizer regressions test into LLVM lit-based testing infrastructure. The goal is to be able to run ASan tests by simply running "make check-asan" command from CMake build tree: * tests should use fresh clang binary from current build tree. * tests should use the same RUN-lines syntax as llvm/clang reg tests.  Next steps: - restricting tests to machines where target is equal to host i.e. where we can produce working binaries. - moving AddressSanitizer unit tests to lit as well.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@161050 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[Sanitizer] Wrapper around llvm::DIContext from LLVM DebugInfo library. If a macro SANITIZER_USES_LLVM_LIBS is defined (by default it is not) then sanitizer runtime includes llvm headers and tries to use LLVM libs for in-process symbolization.

[Sanitizer] move flag parsing routines (and unit tests) from tsan runtime to common runtime.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159928 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan: Go language support fixes   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159856 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[tsan] start using AllocatorCache in CombinedAllocator  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159825 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Small fix: do not replace the default CFAllocator if it has been replaced already.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159824 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[tsan] implement SizeClassAllocatorLocalCache (part of tsan allocator)  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159823 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Because CFAllocatorCreate() should also be called after __CFInitialize() on Lion do so by factoring the CFAllocator logic into ReplaceCFAllocator() which is called from either the __CFInitialize wrapper or __asan_init() depending on which of them is called later.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159822 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
A portable way to check whether __CFInitialize has been called: compare kCFAllocatorSystemDefault._base._cfisa to 0. This should fix http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=87 on both Lion and Snow Leopard.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159821 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Do not check for __CFRuntimeClassTableSize on non-10.6 systems where this symbol is private. This change may cause http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=87 to re-appear on Lion.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159819 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Fix http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=87 by making sure we replace the default CFAllocator only after __CFInitialize has been called.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159749 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan/asan: kill STL First placement new from standard library conflicts with our own. Second we are in trouble if user uses the same function (we either get instrumented code in runtime or non-instrumented code in user program).    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159738 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[TSan] add a new option 'use_internal_symbolizer' that allows to choose between addr2line-based and llvm-based symbolizer w/o having to rebuild the runtime. This is hopefully a temporary solution that simplifies testing process. In the end we should leave a single symbolizer.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159730 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[TSan] Improve output tests: allow reports to contain file:line:column instead of file:line  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159714 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Do not call malloc_zone_from_ptr() for the pointers passed to mz_size() and mz_free(). These callbacks assume that the memory belongs to asan_zone so it's incorrect to pass it to another one. If a need for this appears (e.g. system libraries free the memory using wrong zone) it should be documented.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159713 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[Sanitizer] Extend a symbolizer code. Implemented for Linux only. Use dl_iterate_phdr to get virtual addresses of mapped module sections. To symbolize an address from a module map this module to memory and obtain pointers to debug info sections. Later these pointers can be passed to constructor of DWARF context-in-memory from LLVM DebugInfo lib.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159652 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Add support for building the ASan instrumentation unit tests with the just-built Clang binary and linking them against the just-built ASan runtime.  This is *very* brittle. I expect it will require tweaking and I've pro-actively disabled it on non-Unix builds and on cross-builds.  It is also currently missing dependency edges on GoogleTest header files and a few other corner cases but those can be fixed. This is the major milestone of a mini-bootstrap-like build of the unittest.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159255 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[asan] move tests from asan_interface_test.cc to asan_noinst_test.cc. Now all these tests do not require instrumentation and work directly with asan rt  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159135 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Cleanup the handling of CFLAGS even more in the cmake build for ASan. Add the initial support for building ASan tests.  The first change here is to try to get the CFLAGS to more closely match those used by the old Makefile. There are probably still goofs here ASan folks your review would be appreciated.  The second big change is to add support for building both instrumentation based an non-instrumentation based unittests for ASan. They are built a bit differently from how the old makefiles managed things. Specifically there are two binaries one for the non-instrumented case and one for the instrumented case.  Also the instrumented unit tests rely on the host compiler supporting AddressSanitizer's intrumentation pass. This is kind-of gross but I don't know of a better way yet. I've mailed llvmdev to discuss this issue.  One big caveat is that the detection logic currently doesn't work. I've commented it out temporarily as I'd like to get feedback from the ASan developers etc.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159134 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
[asan] get rid of '#include <malloc.h>' in the implementation of malloc interceptors  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159132 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Another big step toward a viable CMake build system for CompilerRT ASan and friends.  This explicitly switches the CompilerRT CMake build to require CMake version 2.8.8 or newer which provides first-class support for "object" libraries which consist of a pile of '.o' files -- exactly what is desired for composing runtime libraries. I've gone ahead and switched to using this.  I've also added the interception library which I missed initially. And I've added proper dependencies between the various libraries. With this I'm able to build archives for asan that appear to contain all of the necessary .o files.  The final tweak here is to start setting up the compile flags and macro defines expected by ASan and its helper libraries. These may not be entirely correct currently they're based loosely on my reading of the old Makefiles. However they can be tweaked more easily now that they're wired up properly.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159129 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Mechanical change to sink a #ifdef guard for a platform below the include of int_lib.h.  The purpose of this change is to make the C code conform to the pedantic rules of C99 -- an empty translation unit is not valid. It should have absolutely no functional impact and changes nothing about the built libraries.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@159034 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Actually intercept free() to ensure that the deallocations caused by other functions directly calling it are routed to our allocator. For the allocations that do not belong to any malloc zone check whether they're padded with a pointer to ASan's CFAllocator. If so free the original (unpadded) pointer. This should fix AddressSanitizerMac.NSURLDeallocation and issue 70.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@158863 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[tsan] a bit more lint and Makefile changes to run tests from sanitizer_common  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@158821 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Resuming work on the compiler-rt CMake build at long long last. In order to get it working again two changes were needed:  - I had to give up on glob-based file expansion. This just isn't well   supported by CMake and until we convince upstream there of its value   it's not worth dealing with the pain. - Add the common library as otherwise even ASan won't build.  This now builds again although the "correctness" of it is a touch debatable. ;] Specifically there is no merging of the common runtime library with the asan runtime library into a single archive file. I'm not really sure what the best technique is for that and it may be influenced by the ongoing discussion about how best to link runtime libraries.  Note of course that this is still very much WIP. It doesn't entirely work yet and remains disabled by the LLVM projects/CMakeLists.txt until it is in a working state.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@158811 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

tsan: update output tests to race on heap memory Races on stack of main thread are problematic for COMPAT mapping because it's not 1-to-1 and race addr is not properly mapped from shadow back to application memory.  Update output tests to race heap memory.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@156758 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
tsan: fix mmap fd This is mostly to test my commit access. Fixes fd passed to mmap() -1 is the proper invalid fd.    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@156741 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Increase error_message_buffer_size to 64K (16K is insufficient for large programs)    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@156711 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Fix GetFrameNameByAddr hitting stale stack guards.  In the current implementation AsanThread::GetFrameNameByAddr scans the stack for a magic guard value to locate base address of the stack frame. This is not reliable especially on ARM where the code that stores this magic value has to construct it in a register from two small intermediates; this register can then end up stored in a random stack location in the prologue of another function.  With this change GetFrameNameByAddr scans the shadow memory for the signature of a left stack redzone instead. It is now possible to remove the magic from the instrumentation pass for additional performance gain. We keep it there for now just to make sure the new algorithm does not fail in some corner case.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@156710 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[tsan] First commit of ThreadSanitizer (TSan) run-time library.  Algorithm description: http://code.google.com/p/thread-sanitizer/wiki/ThreadSanitizerAlgorithm  Status: The tool is known to work on large real-life applications but still has quite a few rough edges. Nothing is guaranteed yet.  The tool works on x86_64 Linux. Support for 64-bit MacOS 10.7+ is planned for late 2012. Support for 32-bit OSes is doable but problematic and not yet planed.  Further commits coming:   - tests   - makefiles   - documentation   - clang driver patch  The code was previously developed at http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/source/browse/trunk/v2/ by Dmitry Vyukov and Kostya Serebryany with contributions from Timur Iskhodzhanov Alexander Potapenko Alexey Samsonov and Evgeniy Stepanov.     git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@156542 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Partially revert r154390 (http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=rev&revision=154390) Until we work out the solution for http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=65 we'd better not allow the clients to override AddressSanitizer's signal handler.  The second part of r154390 (removing the sighandler-related tests) is not reverted because those tests were broken and didn't test anything.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@154803 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

[ASan] fix output tests - r154570 changed debug info for static functions and now they are symbolized a bit differently  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@154581 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Change the way ASan interacts with custom signal handlers. From now on we allow the clients to override signal handlers set by ASan but print a warning in such a case.

Initial very rough cut at a new CMake build system for compiler-rt. Some high-level notes:  1) An explicit goal is to support building compiler-rt as a subproject    build checked out into the projects/compiler-rt directory. There are    many other possible ways of building the code here but this is    optimized for development on LLVM/Clang/compiler-rt and incremental    trial and testing of the toolchain. 2) The current support is targeted at Linux. I would love to see this    generalized to other platforms but for the sake of simplicity in    testing I'm focusing here first.  Much of this patch was paired with Manuel and I credit him with the majority of the work here.  Some important caveats that I'll be working on in subsequent patches:  1) This uses the host compiler rather than using the just-built-clang. 2) Currently only x86 is supported. 3) Currently none of the tests are built or run. 4) Uses CMake's builtin globbing which doesn't update correctly. 5) This is still turned off from LLVM's CMake build until these issues    are addressed  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@154060 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17
Remove the old and non-functional CMake build system from CompilerRT. I cannot build any part of this successfully on either Linux or Darwin and the replacement is worlds simpler by requiring that this be built as a subproject of LLVM.

This works because we control both the implementation of Printf and all its uses but can be a little misleading.  This change adds support for %z to Printf(). All callers that print sizes and pointers as integers are switched to %zu / %zx.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@153177 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

This patch adds two methods __asan_allocate_island and __asan_deallocate_island and switches our interceptors to using them instead of the default vm_allocate-based approach used by mach_override_ptr.  To simplify the code a fixed memory mapping is used for the allocation pool -- note that we can't mmap an arbitrary chunk of memory because the shadow memory hasn't been mapped yet (for the reasons discussed in http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/issues/detail?id=24 we cannot map the shadow earlier)  The patch drops the program startup time from several second to half a second which speeds up the execution of ASan tests noticeably. Because of the virtual memory size occupied by the programs it's hard to speed up the shutdown time which would've also helped the tests.   git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@148116 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

The code instrumented with ASan may have its own instance of the mach_override library. In this case chances are that functions from it will be called from mach_override_ptr() during ASan initialization. This may lead to crashes (if those functions are instrumented) or incorrect behavior (if the implementations differ).  The attached patch renames mach_override_ptr() into __asan_mach_override_ptr() and makes the rest of the mach_override internals hidden.

lib/int_util: My refactoring to allow shared utility code had a fatal flaw when multiple .a files would end up with duplicate strong definitions. This could cause link failures in certain scenarios when both definitions got loaded.  - The best solution I see for this (aside from not factoring out the utility    code) is to mark the definitions weak. Better solutions appreciated!  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@145427 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

build/SDKs: Sketch a minimal stub SDK for Darwin.  - Motivation is explained in the README but basically it is convenient to be    able to build compiler-rt free standing. Since our external dependencies are    so small we can achieve this relatively easily by just stubbing out the    declarations of the external dependencies.  - This is in no way shape or form intended to be complete it is just the    minimal stubs necessary to support the stuff we use.  git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@144843 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

1) Remove cmake-specific #define usage from the exported Block.h/Block_private.h headers since clients won't know what to set. These are moved into runtime.c as appropriate  2) Use cmake checks for CAS builtins instead of guessing based on GCC #defines (which aren't set by clang and llvm-gcc anyway)  3) "#pragma mark" isn't supported by FSF gcc so "#if 0" it out. It should still show up in IDEs that support it  4) Fix some compiler warnings. GCC 4.3.3 seems super strict about %p. function pointers can't be cast to void * either.  5) Avoid a warning for apple_versioning.c that "ISO C does not allow empty files"    git-svn-id: https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk@82504 91177308-0d34-0410-b5e6-96231b3b80d8, 29707076, 17, 5, 17

Fix bugs with one-off legacy containers  - One-off containers were included in the warning log messages which can   make for unreadable output when there are lots (as there often are).  - Compose was attempting to recreate one-off containers as normal   containers when migrating.

Fix typo in script dir name  Signed-off-by: Ryan Brainard <brainard@heroku.com>, 36344568, 2, 4, 2
Split the domainname out of qualified hostnames.  Docker doesn't like it when a fully qualified hostname is passed in the `hostname` parameter. When an FQDN is provided with `-h` the official CLI puts the first component in `hostname` and the rest in `domainname`. This change replicates that behavior when the user specifies an FQDN in `hostname` in their `fig.yml`.  Signed-off-by: Sam Hanes <sam@maltera.com>, 36344568, 2, 4, 2

Stop `fig run` starting everything when a service has no links  This was thanks to the semantics of project.up() which starts everything if you pass it an empty list of service names.

This greatly simplifies usage of the Service class., 36344568, 2, 4, 2

Use DOCKER_HOST environment variable to find Docker daemon  Removed all "smart" connection logic. Fig either uses the DOCKER_HOST environment variable if it's present or passes `None` to docker-py which does the "right thing" (i.e. falls back to the Unix socket).  This means we no longer know at URL-deciding time whether we can connect to the Docker daemon so we wrap `dispatch` in a `try/except` which catches `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`., 36344568, 2, 4, 2

Upgrade Iris project to support Visual Studio 2017, 41322034, 57, 19, 57
VS 2017 support part 1 (#34)  With this commit the "Hello World" projects should now work in VS 2017 RC3 (and probably older versions too). This is also the first part of support in the IrisExtension. But the fix for that one is more complicated as there are breaking changes in System.Reflection.Metadata. So I don't know if it will even be possible to use the same expression compiler in both (unless of course it didn't use System.Reflection.Metadata). This also updates the project order in the .sln files so that the default startup project is the .vsix project., 41322034, 57, 19, 57

This fixes the following issue caused by files in the APK no longer having an accurate date created:  https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=220039  * Remove unused var CODE_FILE, 41043374, 276, 56, 276
fileUtil: skip “.DS_Store” and “__MACOSX” entries while copying (#215)  Native-side exception occurs while trying to copy `.DS_Store` and `__MACOSX` entries generated by macOS so just skip them. Fix https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/199, 41043374, 276, 56, 276

Bump package.json and plugin.xml for next release, 41043374, 276, 56, 276
Remove cordovaDependencies - does not work with pre-release versions (#183)  Installation on VS fails because the cordovaDependencies resolution logic doesn't work with pre-release versions. Note that removing it will simply result in installation defaulting to the latest version. This should be acceptable as it is highly unlikely at this point for a new user to be using a version of Cordova that we don't support and even if they are there is no version of our plugin that they would be able to use (and our docs do document this limitation clearly)., 41043374, 276, 56, 276

Send plugin version with requests (#178)  * Update sample apps to install CodePush from the working directory * Send the plugin version as a request header  This is just a quick PR to send the plugin version as a header in requests to the CodePush server.  The acquisition SDK version currently being sent with requests is unreliable because it is only updated rarely and because it is shared with the React Native plugin.  Sending the actual `cordova-plugin-code-push` version allows the server to have fine-grained recognition of the exact plugin and version and is necessary for breaking features such as the new CDN used to distribute updates., 41043374, 276, 56, 276
Update /bin directory that was not compiled at the end of the previous PR (#177)  The last commit in the previous PR was not built before being merged which was an oversight., 41043374, 276, 56, 276
Tidy master (#176)  * Accomodate breaking changes in the latest dev dependencies * Update /bin directory to match previous change made in /www directory * Clarify warning about modifying .js files  The latest versions of our dev dependencies have some breaking changes including requiring `typescript` to be installed in addition to the existing `gulp-typescript` and an interface change in `tslint`.  This PR also updates the compiled js output which was missing from a previous PR., 41043374, 276, 56, 276

Add `cordovaDependencies` section to package.json  This adds `engines` elements based on plugin documantation to package.json to comply w/ [new plugin fetching model](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-discuss/blob/master/proposals/plugin-version-fetching.md).  This also adds a 'protective' entry for next major plugin version to protect end-users from fetching edge versions of the plugin by incompatible version of cordova.

Revert "Making --livereload and --devicesync synonyms."  Because of the fact that NOPT parses '--device' as '--devicesync' I'm removing '--devicesync' as a possible option. NOPT's behavior is probably the result of some weird bug in their code.  Also we don't need the '--devicesync' flag here anymore as this plugin won't be used from TACO anymore because I've changed the way LiveReload will be included in TACO (from plugin architecture to package-based architecture): https://github.com/Microsoft/TACO/pull/174  This reverts commit 9fc9038d8f084f263cdf2aa5142849fd32681cd3., 49170125, 1, 0, 1

Making --livereload and --devicesync synonyms.  --livereload and --devicesync can be used interchangeably.    e.g: `cordova run android -- --livereload` is the same as `cordova run android -- --devicesync`    Making them be the same is necessary because of two reasons:      1- From TACO we have to be able to run either `taco run ios android --devicesync` or `taco run android --livereload`      2- Due to a bug in cordova-lib we have to parse process.args and not the context. What this means is that when parsing process.args           ... we'll see --devicesync and not --livereload. otherwise we could have just passed the '--livereload' flag through the plugin's context from TACO., 49170125, 1, 0, 1

Fix to make remote xhr work against Mobile Services  It looks like you now need the Whitelist plugin to be able to make remote xhr requests to Mobile Services (or any remote URL).

Some CSS cleanup in preparation for supporting themes. (#170)  * Moved properties that will support being themed together. * Removed unused / unneeded class names. * Made font size consistent. * Tweaked font size of device-motion and device-orientation help text (was too small with adjusted font sizes). * Set default width of range elements in main CSS rather than plugin HTML files., 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Scale the accelerometer device to fit the current panel width. (#169), 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Scale the compass widget based on current panel width. (#168)  This is important to handle theming scenarios (where font and panel sizes might be larger for example). Other fixes:  * Ensure geolocation and compass help text is centered even when it doesn't fill the panel width. * Center E and W in compass widget. * Correctly initialize compass direction to "N" rather than "NW"., 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Make compass 'wrapper size' multiple of 2 (#167)  This determines how much bigger the background is compared to the compass. It needs to be a multiple of 2 since it is divided by 2 to determine the center point of the outer circle. At its previous value the compass wasn't centered within that outer circle (12 pixels top and left 13 pixels bottom and right)., 43615334, 104, 33, 104

Update Chinese language names and sort XLIFF files by source file order (#158)  The order we process languages can change when we get machine generated translations - depends how quickly they come back. The result is that the order in which we construct the XLIFF files can change. This change sort them first so the order remains consistent.  Also per loc team request update Chinese language names., 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Ran update-loc script. (#157)  * Removed old i18n.json files which are no longer used * Removed separate xlf files which are no longer used (in favor of a single file per language)., 43615334, 104, 33, 104

Updated Device panel and devices list. (#150)  * Updates devices list to reflect modern devices. * Updates Device panel to show more information and replaces Viewport panel. * Allows simulated device to be specified via command line or options. * Spoofs user agent based on platform device and OS version. * Allows different OS versions to be chosen for each device. * Remembers last chosen device per platform (adds "local storage" support on the server side)., 43615334, 104, 33, 104

Merge pull request #124 from Microsoft/improveXHR  Improving XHR proxy, 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Fixing race condition in subscribing to socket events  When using VSCode I found that a single `cordova.exec` call from APP_HOST would sometimes trigger two responses from SIM_HOST. This turns out to be because `onSimHostReady` could be called twice without `resetAppHostState` called in between. As a fix this commit ensures that each handler is only registered once., 43615334, 104, 33, 104
Improving XHR proxy  With the XHR proxy enabled previously we would lose the static properties of XMLHttpRequest such as DONE and LOADING. We now make sure to include these properties.  Additionally since the connection from the app to the proxy always succeeds we do not correctly handle network level failures. Now if there is an error in the communication itself (as distinct from recieving a 404 for example) we report back a 502 Bad Gateway error and include the error message to inform the app developer about the issue., 43615334, 104, 33, 104

Move prepare retry logic from LiveReload to execCordovaPrepare.  Currently LiveReload will try a second time to prepare if the first time fails (usually because of errors trying to create www folder to quickly on Windows). This moves that logic into execCordovaPrepare itself so we gain the same benefit in other scenarios.

Initial import of our release notes  Previously the release notes were living as individual pages on our blog. At the time we started to ship .NET platform libraries as individual NuGet packages that was the solution with the least amount of overhead.  Since we're now fully embracing open source on GitHub it seems much simpler to provide these release notes as Markdown pages., 61668969, 15, 6, 15

ECONNRESET must be used instead of ECONNABORTED. fix for bug: when client does not perform an orderly shutdown of the connection during recv() or read() the error code returned is 'connection reset by peer' or 'connection timed out' according to the opengroup specification (also linux specification). It is not 'operation aborted' which the current code assumes. 'operation aborted' happens during accept(). This fix was needed on RHEL 7 server.

Fix header reading on linux listener using HTTPS.  The first asynchronous read of the stream was stopping at the first CRLF (after the HTTP version) instead of reading until CRLFCRLF (the end of the header).  This bug was not always noticeable because as stated in the boost documentation: "After a successful async_read_until operation the streambuf may contain additional data beyond the delimiter. An application will typically leave that data in the streambuf for a subsequent async_read_until operation to examine." Therefore the bug appeared only when trying to read the body of the request and the streambuf filled by async_read_until did not contain the complete header., 23202799, 1773, 470, 1773

HTTP message sending improvements.  1. Combined typedefs duplicated in compat files into basic_types.h.  2. Update documentation for http_request default constructor and made default to HTTP GET method to avoid ambiguity. Fixes CodePlex #273.  3. For sending HTTP request/response message bodies which are potentially large amounts of user data I replaced our value with move functions with two overloads one taking const reference and the other r-value reference and moving.  4. For sending HTTP request/response message bodies I added overload to work with utf8 strings on Windows. We've received the customer complaints about cross platform strings many times. For a performance critical portion now customers and use UTF-8 for message bodies on all platforms efficiently. On non Windows platforms this saves unnecessary copy and moves in some cases. On Windows this saves a copy and string conversion., 23202799, 1773, 470, 1773

Refactoring websocketpp client to prepare for tls support., 23202799, 1773, 470, 1773
Misc improvements to websockets.  1. Rename namespace from 'web_sockets' to 'websockets' create alias to keep from breaking customers.    Will be removed at next major release. 2. Deleted unnecessary move constructor and move assignment operator from    websocket_client class. 3. Removed unnecessary storage of task completion event for sending messages from    websocket_outgoing_message moved instead to websocket_incoming_message. 4. Added overload to websocket_outgoing_message::set_utf8_message for r-value    references and const reference instead of just taking by value and moving. 5. websocket_outgoing_message::extract_string() - in our implementation the    string always arrives immediately and there was no need to use a    task completion event so I deleted it. Results in less code and storage space. 6. Removed unnecessary websocket_incoming_message::_prepare_to_receive_data() function. 7. Changed our websocket desktop implementation for incoming messages to construct    a container_buffer backed by a std::string and move the raw std::string from websocketpp.    This saves a data copy on all incoming messages and is less code. 8. Changed our winrt implementation for incoming messages to use a container_buffer backed by std::string. 9. We deliver incoming websocket messages to customers in two forms: UTF-8 string and binary stream.    In all cases we control allocation of the underlying stream buffer being used. Previously we were using a producer_consumer_buffer.    Due to changes #8 and #9 before the data is stored in a std::string. This allows an optimization in websocket_incoming_message::extract_string.    We now move the std::string out of the buffer instead of doing an asychronous read. Also saves locking overhead from producer_consumer_buffer    which is thread safe. And less code! 10. Removed some unnecessary string conversions for constructing websocket_exceptions. 11. Replaced some uses of std::unique_lock with std::lock_guard. 12. Misc adding more comments const to some APIs passing by reference make_unique etc..., 23202799, 1773, 470, 1773

Fixing error reporting in Linux file streams. For some reason the original implementation was just creating an exception with a hardcoded string error message. This is bad since it looses the underlying error code and doesn't follow the exception type used on other platforms std::system_error. I updated to check the errno and create a std::system_error exception with the error code included. This results in less OS specific code as well., 23202799, 1773, 470, 1773

Fixed up some http_listener linux request parsing issues. 1. If an invalid URI was presented during parsing it would crash the server. 2. Fixed parsing of HTTP headers to not allow a header that starts with a colon since it is invalid. 3.

Merge pull request #61 from YixuanLiu/ConsumerOffsetsFix  ConsumerOffset fix when OffsetOutOfRange, 52044237, 345, 71, 345
When FetcherRunnable detects about outOfRange it tries to fix the issue by bump up both fectedoffset and consumedoffset ahead to the valid one. As Fetcher thread don't own and shouldn't own the consumedoffset the consumerIterator who is the actual owner of consumedoffset update the consumedoffset back to the position it actually consumed. In the next iteration of Fetcher thread it detects that the lag between fectedoffset consumedoffset is big enough so it stop fetching more. It is true during normal case but it is not true when the fetchedoffset being manually set ahead instead of fetched ahead.  The fix is first FetcherRunnable shouldn't just set the consumedoffset as it doesn't own how far it consumed. When FetcherRunnable detects about outofrange error it signal PartitionTopicInfo to fix its offset. Creae a private variable lastKnownGoodNextRequestOffset for pti to save the old marker of NextRequestOffset When OutOfRange happens. In the next iteration of fetcher use that to caculate the actual messages in the queue. After the successful fetch it set back to align with NextRequestOffset.  Also cleaned up messageOffset as it is never being used., 52044237, 345, 71, 345

The DataType TableType and UserDefinedType types are all returned by several different relationships. The issue is that there is no common interface that all these types implement. This causes issues when returning user defined types and table types from the following relationships: Column.DataType ClrTypeMethodParameter.DataType Parameter.DataType and TableTypeColumn.DataType as the relationships are defined to only return TSqlDataTypeReference. The fix is to add a new interface ISqlDataType that is implemented by DataType TableType and UserDefinedType. The return type of the "DataType" properties with the issue are now changed to return "ISqlDataType" so there is no casting exception: Test:TestColumnUserDefinedTypesTestParamterWithUserDefinedTypes, 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Added sample covering use of Deployment Contributor during bacpac import. This scenario was added in recent versions of DacFx and allows the same control over bacpac deployment as is supported for dacpacs. The only difference is that you need to use DacImportOptions instead of DacDeployOptions., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Correct typo in TSqlModelElementReference.IsResolved name. Correct typo in ModelMessages.InvalidObjectType name. Correct typo in TSqlModelElementReference.GetMetadataProperty name. Add GetMetadataProperty property to the ISqlModelElementReference interface. Make TSqlModelElementReference.GetMetadataProperty public instead of proteced.  Update unittests to cover GetMetdata and GetMetdataProperty methods: TestTableValuedFunction TestIndexColumnMetadata, 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Merge pull request #2 from Microsoft/Dev  Add unresolved elemements plus metadata properties, 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Added a sample to show validation of the contents of a "File" you plan on adding into a database. In this case we simulate validating a query.  During the writing of this sample a bug in DacFx was discovered where for Database-sourced models the AddOrUpdate and DeleteObjects methods do not correctly delete the contents of a file. This will be fixed in DacFx in a future release., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Added example of running code analysis rules directly against a database. Also added framework for creating and dropping test DBs to support this action and refactored some related code to use common methods., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Fixed documentation error  Clarifying the difference in behavior between ExplicitVisit and Visit based on internal feedback., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Fix metadata for TableValuedFunction now that DacFx bug is fixed: TableValuedFunctions now correctly has a Columns relationship. A new TableOption relationship has been created that returns a ClrTableOption element. The TableOptionElement has an OrderColumns property to store the column sort order of the data. ModelDefects.cs was removed as no other known model bugs exist. Updated Error reporting for model.tt to display the type and relationship name when a missing relationship is found in modelmetadata.xml., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Fixed regression covered by the TestTableType test. The regression caused composed adapted unspecialized relationships to throw a cast exception. The elements where incorrectly being cast instead of calling AdaptInstance on the returned element.  Added unittest TestSignatures to cover more composed relationships that are adapted but not specialized., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Refactor to support unresolved elements. This requires changing all calls from GetReferenced to GetReferencedRelationshipInstances for Peer and Hierarchical relationships. With methods now returning unresolved elements a new Reference sub class for each Model type is defined. The reference sub types adapts a ModelRelationshipInstance instead of a TSQLObject. Adapting a ModelRelationshipInstance instead of a TSQLObject allows the name of referenced elements to be exposed even if the element is unresolved. It also allows exposing the metadata on relationships (Such as Ascending on the Index.Columns relationship). For each relationship that has metadata a new sub type is defined with the metadata properties. This results in the Index.Columns relationship returning an IEnumerable<IndexColumnsReference> where IndexColumnsReference derives from TSQLColumnReference which in-turn derives from TSQLColum. Metadata properties on TSQLObjecs are now exposed. One example of this is TSQLColumn now exposes a ColumnType property which defines if it is a Column ComputedColumn or ColumnSet. NOTE: In order to facilitate unresolved references a few edge cases arose. For relationships that returned marker interfaces like ISqlObjectAuthorizer there was no concrete type known at generation time to instantiate. To work around this issue a new optional attribute was added to the modelmetadata.xml: UnresolvedReturnType. The UnresolvedReturnType attribute defines the type to instantiate when an unresolved element is found so the return type will still implement the type defined in the ReturnType attribute. This pattern is a little unconventional however to enforce the strongly typed returns values of relationships these “Unresolved” types needed to be created to bridge the gap between the strongly typed API and the unresolved nature of the model., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Fixing Typos in several places Adding workaround for the missing AzureV12 enumeration value in SqlServerVersions. (AzureV12) interfaces are now generated. Fix TestTableType unittest. Assert on column expression dependencies was incorrect., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Add a bunch of metods to SqlTypedModel to allow adding updating and removing elements. made the TSqlTypedModel disposable as it adapts the TSqlModel which is disposable. Fixed unit tests to dispose of the typed model, 30130401, 58, 22, 58

Remove unused SpecializeForVersion attribute from model metadata Add AdaptInstance attribute to model metadata to control return unadapted types.  Removed ISqlTypeSpecifierBase marker interface as it is not needed. The public model already removes the TypeSpecifier concept., 30130401, 58, 22, 58
Add the ability to override property names to the modelmetadata.xml Created new ISpecifiesStorage interface for objects that specify data compression. (TODO: add more relationships to the interface)     Made TSQLIndex TSQLTable TSQLPrimaryKeyContraint and TSQLUniqueConstraint implement ISpecifiesStorage. SpatialIndex was not added because while it does support compression it is modeled as a single property. I will need to adjust this to make SpatialIndex conform., 30130401, 58, 22, 58

Improved /deterministic switch and marked some remaining cases (with "BUG" in the test file) as to-do items, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added an optional argument to array allocation a function that says how to initialize the elements of the array.  Closes #84. Changed design to only allow a function as an argument (not the initial element itself) with a trying-to-be-helpful error message if the user mixes these up.  The further request to be able to initialize an array with a sequence of given elements is (probably) forthcoming., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

These server tests continue to confuse me. Their output is nondeterministic across different runs and different machines. Therefore I'm effectively disabling these tests. Better would be to fix the tests to be deterministic but I don't know how to edit the tests from some kind of source.

Updated version number to 1.9.9  Dafny version 1.9.9 includes the following changes over version 1.9.8:  Language  * Allow TLA+ style conjunctions and disjunctions.  * Allow the first datatype constructor to be preceded by a `|`.  * Destructor names can now be shared among datatype constructors.  * Added two-state functions and two-state predicates.  * Two-state lemmas no longer support `reads` clauses.  Instead   use the new `unchanged` predicate.  * Added `unchanged` predicate which takes a frame argument and says   those things are the same in the pre- and post-states.  * `fresh` applied to a collection now says that all elements of the   collection are `fresh`.  This is a change in semantics from before.  * `allocated` predicate (re-)introduced.  It says that its argument   is available in the state.  * Inside an `old` disallow `unchanged` `fresh` two-state functions   two-state lemmas and nested `old`.  * Added `const` declarations.  * Added conversions between `char` an integral types.  * Function results can now be named for use in the function's   postcondition.  * Added operations that rotate bits in bitvectors.  * `map` and `imap` now have `.Keys` `.Values` and `.Items` members.  * Language support for revealing `{:opaque}` functions.  Use   `reveal F()` instead of the previous `reveal_F()`.  * Support for tuples in `match` constructs.  * Expand the repertoire of constructs where co-recursive function calls are recognized.  * Proper support for type parameters in inductive and co-inductive predicates.  * Allow `reads` clauses on inductive and co-inductive predicates.  * Disallow parameters marked with `ghost` in signatures that are already ghost.  Modules  * Class members can be individually exported.  * Datatypes can now be exported as provided or revealed.  * All datatypes can be revealed by `reveal *`.  * Opened imports are not exported.  * `exclusively refines` is no longer supported.  * Module facades may now only be refined by explicit refinements.   The previous structural checks are no longer supported.  Verification  * Improved string support  * More quantifier rewriting to help avoid matching loops in particular   address quantifiers like `forall i :: 1 <= i < a.Length ==> a[i-1] <= a[i]`  Pipeline  * Speed-ups in resolution and translation (and added `/optimizeResolution` flag).  * Set appropriate exit value for Dafny errors.  * Use .NET Framework 4.5.  * Use Z3 version 4.4.2 (private build Oct 2016).  IDEs  * Syntax highlight bitvectors in Visual Studio.  * Show some Boogie resolution errors in lieu of many a   "Verification process error" in Visual Studio.  * Improved caching.  Advanced settings  * Improvement in manual fuel settings.  * `/allocated` option which encodes allocatedness in alternate ways.  * `/printIncludes` option.  * `/disableScopes` option.  * Handle `:warnShadowing` attribute on methods and lemmas.  * As an optimization Boogie implementations with no proof obligations   are no longer emitted.  * Don't verify modules that came from an include.  Miscellaneous  * Bug fixes in subset types.  * Various bug fixes including many Issues reported on github., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

If the bound var created for avoid matching loop is added to the inner quantifier expr's bound var list don't add it to the outter  quantifier's bound var list again.

Rewrite quantifiers to avoid matching loop.  When matching loops is detected in a quantifier during tigger selection the quantifier will be split along conjunctions and each resulting quantifier will be rewritten and then trigger select independently.

Fix incorrect translation of forallstmt  1. For forall proof we used to use initEtran to translate boundvars and range and etran to translate the Ens. To switch between initEtran and etran when translating the corresponding forallexpression of the forallproof we made initEtran as the Old of etran. However with the commit# bdf8eb3 we only need etran therefore making the code that switch between etran and initEtran not needed for forallproof. 2. For forallstmtcall there are code for handling translating the stmt when there is no corresponding forallexpression. In stead of  using TrExpr for forallstmtcall that has forallexpression we use the same code as the first case and then add the triggers from forallexpression. 3. We quantify over heap for calls that don't use heap so quantifier can preserve across method calls since we always include the heap as an argument even in non-heap reading functions (see test\dafny4\bug144.dfy). However we don't need to quantify over heap for calls that uses heap. 4. Fix forallexpression rewrite for forallstmtcall so that triggers can be generated. Closes #67., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

CompileSignature for ModuleExportDecl was set wrong.  After cloning module definition before second pass resolve we set the ModuleExportDecl's compileSignature to the cloned module's signature which is wrong since we could be exporting only part of the module. Instead we should update the ModuleExportDecl's signature to point to the cloned modules. Also when importing from more than one exports we always set the compileSignature to the last export's compileSignature which is wrong. We need to merge the compileSignatures instead.

Add a field to InferredTypeProxy to indicate whether contraints should be kept in type inference  When an type proxy is used in seq map and user defined types it should keep its type constraints during type inference.

Better way of fixing #46 #47 and #48  Previous fix is to find all the use of method's Body field and add a check for whether the body needs to be processed before processing method body.

Don't empty methodbody of lemma from include file while resolving  Methodbody of lemma from include files is emptied in pre-resolve rewrite phase in order to speed up resolver and translator.

Instead of using rewrite to empty the methodbody simply just stop resolve and translator methodbody if a lemma is from included file. Closes #46., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

tests and corrections for unchanged, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added "allocated" expressions which say that the argument expression which can be of any type is available in the state.  The "allocated" expression is typically used with "old" as in "old(allocated(E))" (note that "E" also sits inside the "old" in this example).  Changed "fresh" so that no longer is allowed to take a datatype argument (which was kinda bogus anyway).  Where "!fresh(D)" was used before try "old(allocated(D))" instead.  Changed semantics of "fresh" so that its value on a (set/seq) collection is simply the fold of "fresh" on all of the elements.  In particular this means that if the collection contains "null" then "fresh" will return "false".  This is likely to affect some classes specified with almost-the-standard dynamic-frames idiom -- make sure "Valid()" includes a conjunct "null !in Repr".  Fixed bug in the verification translation of local variables without initializing assignments.

first attempt at hiding types and function bodies  No effect on translation yet just type/consistency check so far., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Sometimes Dafny picks multiple triggers and one has a fuel argument while the other does not.  This causes a problem when we're quantifying over fuel.  The somewhat hackish solution is to augment the latter type of trigger with AsFuelBottom which is (almost) always in scope., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Modify our approach to fuel even further.  From now on we will never use a specific fuel value or constant in a Dafny-generated trigger.  Instead we (if necessary) add a quantified fuel variable and use it only in the trigger. Note that this doesn't apply to the function axioms that Dafny generates directly., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Change of line endings, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Merge branch 'fuel-fixes'  Major fixes to how fuel is handled particularly for opaque functions. - Adding opaque and/or fuel annotations will no longer on their own cause functions to be treated as higher order - Literal axioms now require at least one fuel which means they can't be used to bypass opaque   - This means that a few cases that used to pass thanks to Lit may need a bit more fuel now. - The consequence axiom now quantifies over fuel so its effects are visible even when you have no fuel., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Test cases previously shoved through with brute force now verify successfully after the fix to the consequence axiom., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Consequence axiom was in the case of recursive mentions in ensures resetting fuel to its original setting which caused trigger storms.  The original version of Floyd now verifies., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Try to fix up some failing tests by providing a bit more help to cope with Lit axiom's fuel barrier., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Revert "In dafny4/Ackermann.dfy we no longer had quite enough fuel for one of the proofs to go through automatically.  We bottom out at LZ with a literal that previously would have used the Lit axiom to take an additional step but now that the Lit axioms need fuel it can't make that extra step."  This reverts commit f0c726228dfb380234d94d0b07fba5f05980f7a3.  The LZ axiom fixed Ackermann and possibly one other test file but it opens another hole in our opaque barrier.  This example comes from dafny0/Fuel.dfy     function {:fuel 00} pos(x:int) : int     {         if x < 0 then 0         else 1 + pos(x - 1)     }      method test(y:int z:int)         requires y > 5;         requires z < 0;     {         assert pos(-1) == 0;            // error: Lits also obey opaque now     }  The problem is that 	pos(StartFuelAssert_TestModule3._default.pos $Heap LitInt(0 - 1)) turns into: 	pos(AsFuelBottom(StartFuelAssert_TestModule3._default.pos) $Heap LitInt(0 - 1)) which turns into 	pos(LZ $Heap LitInt(0 - 1)) which then uses the new LZ axiom to bypass the opaque barrier., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Make the consequence axiom trigger off of any fuel not just StartFuel_F.  dafny4/FlyingRobots.dfy was failing because the consequence axiom for Valid was triggered off of StartFuel__module.Bot.Valid whereas the ensures for the constructor mentions StartFuelAssert__module.Bot.Valid.  Without a reveal (or a well crafted assert) we don't know that those are related to each other.  As a result of this change dafny4/ACL2-extractor.dfy and dafny2/SnapshotableTrees.dfy now pass., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
In dafny4/Ackermann.dfy we no longer had quite enough fuel for one of the proofs to go through automatically.  We bottom out at LZ with a literal that previously would have used the Lit axiom to take an additional step but now that the Lit axioms need fuel it can't make that extra step.  Possible solution: Add a Lit axiom for LZ as well.  This would still prevent Lit from bypassing opaque since our current approach to opaque doesn't actually specify how much fuel an opaque function has (until you call reveal).  It has to be a separate axiom (not just an additional trigger on the existing axioms) since the proposed trigger wouldn't mention the quantified layer variable.  After this change dafny4/GHC-MergeSort.dfy also passes., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
The literal axioms now require at least one fuel to trigger.  This results in many test cases now behaving more like you might expect.  Four new tests now fail:     dafny2/SnapshotableTrees.dfy     dafny4/ACL2-extractor.dfy     dafny4/Ackermann.dfy     dafny4/FlyingRobots.dfy     dafny4/GHC-MergeSort.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Remove the old version of opaque in favor of the new fuel-based opaque. Fix (in favor of the new version) several spots where the differences between the two weren't being handled properly.  Four test cases currently failing:     dafny0/OpaqueFunctions.dfy     dafny0/Protected.dfy     dafny2/SnapshotableTrees.dfy     dafny4/FlyingRobots.dfy Most problems appear to be due to functions with Lit arguments (or no arguments) bypassing opaque., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

attempt at consistency check for module exports  Still need to augment reveal/opaque functionality to really test this., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Update our approach to fuel.  • When specifying fuel in an annotation e.g. {:fuel Foo X Y} we will only support values (XY) = (00) or (XX+1) • When a function is opaque we will not specify any values for StartFuel and StartFuelAssert in the prelude of a method though they will still be declared as AsFuelBottom fixed points. • Whenever a function is invoked it should use StartFuel/StartFuelAssert rather than BaseFuel., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
When calling reveal or for a fuel annotation on a statement write the StartFuel and StartFuelAssert values in terms of different constants rather than the same ones.  This avoids creating trigger loops.  This Closes #9.  However some test cases still fail due to issues with how fuel is being used at present., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix issue 144. For a trigger on a function call it is translated into boogie using the current heap as the heap argument. This prevent quantifier expr to preserve across method calls. The fix is to translate the trigger using the heap  as an quantifier bound var so the old heap will instanstiate the quantifier  expr and frame axiom can be used to prove it across method calls., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Allow users to annontate a method as main with {:main} attribute. It’s an error if more than one method is so annotated. For that method the usual restrictions for "main" apply but it is allowed to take ghost arguments and it is allowed to have preconditions.  This lets the programmer add some explicit assumptions about the outside world modeled for example via ghost parameters., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix issue 125. Add the missing case 2 and 3 with refinement and opened imports. For the following situation  module LibA {  // ...things declared here...  }   module LibB {  // ...things declared here...  }   module R {  import opened LibA  // ...things declared here...  }   module S refines R {  import opened LibB  // ...declared here...  }   1. If module R declares a TopLevelDecl “G” then we should report an error if S  attempts to declare an incompatible TopLevelDecl “G”. Dafny does this already.   2. If LibA declares a TopLevelDecl “G” but R does not directly declare any  TopLevelDecl G” then we should also issue an error for any TopLevelDecl “G”  in S. This behavior is missing in Dafny.   3. If each of LibA and LibB declares some TopLevelDecl “G” but neither R nor S  directly declares any TopLevelDecl “G” then no error should be issued and  any use of “G” in S should resolve to the “G” in LibA. This behavior is missing  in Dafny., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix issue 129. When looking for a constructor for which Dafny knows how to instantiate all it arguments don't stop as soon as one instantiable constructor is found. Instead figure out all instantiable constructors and then pick the best among these. A simple and reasonable "best" is an instantiable constructor that requires a minimal number of already constructed type arguments and to break ties among these pick the first one listed., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix build and test failures cleanup grammar.  1. A build failure caused by a method call before a contract was fixed. 2. An absolute path in an ".expect" file was changed to relative. 3. I eliminated the TopDecls and DeclModifiers non-terminals.    They were giving a warning from Coco/R about being deletable.    Instead I used repetition of the TopDecl or DeclModifier    non-terminals where they had been used. I think this is    also cleaner to talk about., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Add ExternNegative2.dfy.expect.  In the prior commit the ExternNegative2.dfy.expect file was accidentally not included. It is needed in order for that test to pass., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Implement 'extern' declaration modifier.  The 'extern' declaration modifier provides a more convenient way of interfacing Dafny code with C# source files and .Net DLLs.  We support an 'extern' keyword on a module class function method or method (cannot extern ghost). We check the CompileNames of all modules to make sure there are no duplicate names.  Every Dafny-generated C# class is marked partial so it can potentially be extended.  The extern keyword could be accompanied by an optional string naming the corresponding C# method/class to connect to. If not given the name of the method/class is used.  An 'extern' keyword implies an {:axiom} attribute for functions and methods so their ensures clauses are assumed to be true without proof.  In addition to the .dfy files the user may supply C# files (.cs) and dynamic linked libraries (.dll) on command line. These will be passed onto the C# compiler the .cs files as sources and the .dll files as references.  As part of this change the grammar was refactored some. New productions are  - TopDecls - a list of top-level declarations. - TopDecl - a single top-level declaration - DeclModifiers - a list of declaration modifiers which are   either 'abstract' 'ghost' 'static' 'protected' or 'extern'.   They can be in any order and we diagnose duplicates.   In addition since they are not all allowed in all contexts   we check and give diagnostics if an DeclModifier appears   where it is not allowed., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix issue 114. Do not export private terms for ComprehensionExpr in trigger collectors., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix printing for ForallStmt. Previously we traverse the resolved forall expressions to get the attributes for the forallstmt which is flawed since the forallexpr could have been splitted into different subquantifiers each with different triggers.  PrintExpression already knows how to print out splitted forall expressions so we use it to print the resolved forall expressions instead., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fixed compilation of equality between reference types, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix issue 101. Instead of swapping operands for Exp opcode in BinaryExpr swap them when the expr is first created in parser or for calcstmt. This avoids problems of operands being swapped again when the expr is copied., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix issue 99. When annotate a quantifier expr that has a SplitQuantifier we need exclude the private terms (the ones that includes the quantifier expr's bv) from it exported terms., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

In method and iterator specifications inline top-level predicates (except protected predicated in cross-module calls) like in other places., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Introduced new datatype update syntax:  D.(f := E) The old syntax D[f := E] is still supported for a short while but generates a warning about that syntax being deprecated. The new syntax also supports multiple updates:  D.(f := E0 g := E1 h := E2), 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Made /rewriteFocalPredicates:1 the default, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Hover text includes #[_k-1] suffix for terms rewritten in prefix predicates/lemmas (this fixes an item from the wishlist). Include in hover text the extreme predicates for which an extreme lemmas has been rewritten (but don't include ==# in this list--or should it perhaps be included?). Under a (temporary) switch /rewriteFocalPredicates each use of a focal predicate P in a prefix lemma is rewritten into P#[_k-1]., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Implement workarounds for some tests that fail with /autoTriggers.  The issues here are mostly with induction (wrt. to trigger selection and quantifier splitting) and with expressions like P(i j-1) where no good choices are available., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Suppress many warnings in the test suite.  We already have separate tests for those and we want the output to be the same with and without /autoTriggers., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Make the packaging script Windows-compatible, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Look for z3 in Binaries/z3/bin (but keep the vendored version for convenience)  Dafny now first looks for a z3 binary in z3/bin and if it can't find one it looks for one in Binaries/z3.exe (mostly for backwards-compatibility with already set-up source installations)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Further relax the loop detection conditions  Mismatches are now allowed up to expressions not involving any of the bound variables of the quantifier under inspection., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Write a new packaging script for Dafny  This is intended to superseed the PrepareDafnyZip.bat script. I tried doing this as an msbuild config then as a makefile but the first one was too cumbersome and the second one required too many dependencies to work properly (and parsing JSON from a makefile is not fun).  The new script calls the Github API to retrieve the description of the latest z3 release downloads the zip corresponding to each supported platfom and packages one copy of Dafny for each copy of z3 that the latest release contains.  The next step will be to make Dafny load its binary from the z3 folder., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Replace the Emacs mode files by a pointer to the boogie-friends repo.  Does mercurial support submodules? That could be a good option too., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added /autoTriggers to two tests where it only makes a cosmetic difference, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Replace b || !b by true in Snapshots5.v1.dfy  We can't prove `exists b: bool :: b || !b` when splitting is enabled at least for now and there's already a separate test for that particular issue in wishlist/, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Add a 'tutorial' folder to the distribution with an initial example.  It would be nice to gather neat Dafny examples there; each new feature could have its own small file that demoes it and we could also have examples that showcase stuff that we think is impressive.  I'm adding this as a test folder because it's important to check that these cool examples don't break but the focus probably shouldn't be on exhaustively testing the features being demoed., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Make `old` a special case for trigger generation.  Old is particular because in old(g(f(x))) the triggers are old(g(x)) and old(f(x)). This has a number of implications; see the new tests files for more information., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Add a few things to the wishlist, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Adjust WF checks to use unsplit quantifiers.  The logic about split quantifiers is that Boogie (and z3) should never realize that there was an unsplit quantifier. The WF check code does not produce a quantifier at least in it's checking part; thus it should use original quantifier. This fixes a problem in VerifyThis2015/Problem2.dfy with a null check and a problem spotted by Chris made into a test case saved in triggers/wf-checks-use-the-original-quantifier.dfy. The issue boiled down to being able to verify (forall x :: x != null && x.a == 0).  Of course the assumption that WF checks produce for a quantifier is a quantifier so it uses the split expression., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Implement the SelectTrigger method removing redundant triggers.  The idea is that we define an partial order on triggers (which may contain multiple terms) and find all the maximal elements. The algorithm as implemented is rather inefficient; in particular is does not look at the structure of the graph of the relation (thus is does many redundant comparisons). See triggers/useless-triggers-are-removed.dfy for an example where such a filter is useful., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Move indentation of error messages to the ConsoleErrorReporter  This indentation is just needed by CLI-based clients, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Discard error messages that refer to a non-nested TokenWrapper.  The VS extension already did that but it also filtered out nested tokens. That prevented info about triggers from being reported. Other interfaces (the CLI and Emacs in particular) should have the same ability.  Surprinsingly this doesn't cause any tests failures., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Review preceding commit with Rustan, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Start committing split quantifiers  This requires rewriting the parts of the AST that contain these quantifiers. We unfortunately don't have facilities to do such rewrites at the moment (and there are loops in the AST so it would be hard to write such a facility). As a workaround this commit introduces a field in quantifier expressions SplitQuantifiers. Code that manipulate triggers is expected to look for this field and ignore the other fields if that one is found., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Implement self-loop detection  Implementing loop detection between multiple triggers is much harder as it seems to require walking an exponentially sized graph. Self-loop detection is still a net gain compared to the current situation: we used to not detect loops in large quantifiers; not we break these apart suppress the loops where we can in the smaller parts and report the ones that we can't suppress. It could be that the broken-up quantifiers are mutually recursive but these cases would have already led to a loop in the past., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Tiny refactoring in the extension's driver, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix an issue with column numbers in the VS extension  The error came from the fact that Dafny now consistently used 0-based indexing. Boogie gets its traces from text that's inserted by Dafny in the Boogie file so there's no need to apply an extra offset in the VS extension., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Add quotes in snapshot tests.  Thanks Valentin for elucidating this issue!, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Implement a Dafny server.  The Dafny server is a command line utility that allows non-.Net editors to take advantage of Dafny's caching facilities as used by the Dafny extension for Visual Studio. The server is essentially a REPL which produces output in the same format as the Dafny CLI; clients thus do not need to understand the internals of Dafny's caching. A typical editing session proceeds as follows:  * When a new Dafny file is opened the editor starts a new instance of the   Dafny server. The cache is blank at that point. * The editor sends a copy of the buffer for initial verification. This takes   some time after which the server returns a list of errors. * The user makes modifications; the editor periodically sends a new copy of   the buffer's contents to the Dafny server which quickly returns an updated   list of errors.  The client-server protocol is sequential uses JSON and works over ASCII pipes by base64-encoding queries. It defines one type of query and two types of responses:  Queries are of the following form:    verify    <base64 encoded JSON payload>    [[DAFNY-CLIENT: EOM]]  Responses are of the following form:    <list of errors and usual output as produced by the Dafny CLI>    [SUCCESS] [[DAFNY-SERVER: EOM]] or    <error message>    [FAILURE] [[DAFNY-SERVER: EOM]]  The JSON payload is an array with 4 fields:    * args:   An array of Dafny arguments as passed to the Dafny CLI    * source: A Dafny program or the path to a Dafny source file.    * sourceIsFile: A boolean indicating whether the 'source' argument is a                    Dafny program or the path to one.    * filename:     The name of the original source file to be used in error                    messages  For small files embedding the Dafny source directly into a message is convenient; for larger files however it is generally better for performance to write the source snapshot to a separate file and to pass that to Dafny by setting the 'sourceIsFile' flag to true., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fixed crash in resolution where after reporting an error the cases #type and #module were not handled, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Bump up the time limit in runTests.py and save a bit of space in output, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix: Read clauses should be checked before lit lifting  The function IgnoreFuel in UnfoldingPerformance.dfy used to be lit-wrapped. It shouldn't be because its reads clause is non-empty. This is not a soundness bug but fixing it improves performance in cases where a function call would be incorrectly unrolled.  Test case written by Rustan., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix a bug with includes and /useBaseNameForFileName  If /useBasenameForFilename is specified tokens just contain file names which is not enough to locate included files.  Solution based on Rustan's advice., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Let runTests.py generate expect files  That is missing expect files now raise a warning not an error., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix: Unify column numbers in Dafny's errors  Dafny counts from 0 but Boogie counts from 1. Tokens are 1-based. Thus when we print tokens we need to decrement the column number. This was done for resolver errors but not for verification or parsing errors. In addition parsing errors were inconsistent with resolution errors case-wise.  Unfortunately the fix affects the output of many tests., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix: Visual studio did not show warnings.  To check if the fix works try declaring a static top level function. Initial work on this patch by Rustan, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Weaken the trigger cycling check to allow more patterns, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix broken interaction between triggers and inlining of function calls  The problem was that inlining would replace formals with arguments in triggers as well causing invalid expressions ("trigger killers") to pop up in triggers after inlining.  This fix disables inlining if it can't be determined that it won't lead to an invalid trigger. If that procedure is incomplete then that's only by a narrow margin as the checks actually ensure that the formals that are getting trigger killers are indeed used in triggers., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Detect matching loops at the mutli-trigger level  Stop using HashSet as we don't currently have a good HashCode implementation. Instead excplicitly call distinct where needed. Improve reporting a bit., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Type parameters in method/function signatures are no longer auto-declared.  Although convenient and concise the auto-declare behavior has on many occasions caused confusion when a type name has accidentally been mistyped (and Dafny had then accepted and auto-declared the name). Note the behavior of filling in missing type parameters is still supported.  This mode although unusual (even original?) in languages is different from the auto- declare behavior.  For auto-declare identifiers could be used in the program without having a declaration.  For fill-in parameters the implicitly declared type parameters remain anonymous., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Compile function methods into C# in a more efficient manner at least for some common expressions., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Add the ability to specify how much "fuel" a function should have i.e. how many times Z3 is permitted to unfold it's definition.  The new {:fuel} annotation can be added to the function itself it which case it will apply to all uses of that function or it can overridden within the scope of a module function method iterator calc forall while assert or assume.  The general format is:  {:fuel functionNamelowFuelhighFuel}  When applied as an annotation to the function itself omit functionName. If highFuel is omitted it defaults to lowFuel + 1.  The default fuel setting for recursive functions is 12.  Setting the fuel higher say to 34 will give more unfoldings which may make some proofs go through with less programmer assistance (e.g. with fewer assert statements) but it may also increase verification time so use it with care.  Setting the fuel to 00 is similar to making the definition opaque except when used with all literal arguments., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix a bug spotted by Chris in my BigInteger patch; thanks!  The problem was this:   Console.WriteLine(Int64.Parse("08000000000000000" NumberStyles.HexNumber));   // => -9223372036854775808   Console.WriteLine(Int64.Parse("9223372036854775808"));   // => Value was either too large or too small for an Int64.  In other words large hex numbers are interpreted as a sequence of bits not as an actual number., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Merge, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Combined some common routines into CheckWellformedAndAssume which also allows an improvement of the generated Boogie (which will be especially good soon when reads-clause checking may change), 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Small improvements to runTests.py, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Add a compatibility layer over BigInteger.Parse  Mono currently does not implement support for BigInteger.Parse so use Int64 if possible and throw the same error as was previously returned otherwise. This is not too much of a problem in practice because most of the integers that we actually come across in real-life source files seem to fit in an Int64., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fix some issues when compiling generic types and generic function method calls, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix the UseBaseNameForFileName flag; it shouldn't set the return code to zero.  The test suite relies on error codes all being zero (except for preprocessing errors) so add a flag for that (as suggested in a source comment)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fix lit headers implicitly relying on bash-style constructs  Window's batch doesn't recognize ";" as a command separator; lit has a workaround for that bu it's just as simple to do the right thing on our side., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Add the beginning of a new testing infrastructure  runTests.py reads lit-style annotations so we will be able to retain lit compatibility. This new framework adds:  * Precise timings * Proper support for interrupting using Ctrl+C * Much better reporting (including tracking of error codes and merging   of successive reports for performance tracking) * No dependency on lit OutputCheck or Diff * Pretty colors!, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Rearranged handling ambiguously named declarations so that the multitudes of ambiguous names that arise when layers of modules are opened-imported don't cause gross memory waste.  In particular previously the names of many such ambiguous declarations were shown to exceed 1 million characters the way they had been constructed.

Removed some old and unused functions, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
This changeset changes the default visibility of a function/predicate body outside the module that declares it. The body is now visible across the module boundary. To contain the knowledge of the body inside the module mark the function/predicate as 'protected'.  Semantics of 'protected': * The definition (i.e. body) of a 'protected' function is not visible outside the defining module * The idea is that inside the defining module a 'protected' function may or may not be opaque. However this will be easier to support once opaque/reveal are language primitives. Therefore for the time being {:opaque} is not allowed to be applied to 'protected' functions. * In order to extend the definition of a predicate in a refinement module the predicate must be 'protected' * The 'protected' status of a function must be preserved in refinement modules, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Language change: All functions and methods declared lexically outside any class are now automatically static and fields are no longer allowed to be declared there.  Stated differently all heap state must now be declared inside an explicitly declared class and functions and methods declared outside any class can be viewed as belonging to the module.  The motivating benefit of this change is to no longer need the 'static' keyword when declaring a module of functions and methods., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Merge, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Change behavior of 'decreases *' which can be applied to loops and methods.  Now loops that may possibly do an infinite number of iterations (that is loops marked with 'decreases *') and calls to methods marked with 'decreases *' are allowed only in methods that themselves are marked with 'decreases *'.  As before ghost loops and ghost methods are not allowed to be marked with 'decreases *'.  Previously 'decreases *' was allowed on a method only if the method was tail recursive; this is no longer so.  Note however that if the method is not tail recursive and engages in infinite recursion then it will eventually run out of stack space.  Previously a 'decreases *' was not inherited in a refining module; this is no longer so. That is 'decreases *' is now inherited.  To refine a possibly non-terminating method or loop the refining version simply provides a decreases clause that does not mention '*'. Note that if the refined method is not recursive it still needs to have _some_ decreases clause in order not to inherit the 'decreases *' from the refined method but the expression stated in the decreases clause can be arbitrary (for example one can write 'decreases true' or 'decreases 7' or 'decreases x' for some 'x' in scope).  Note in the new design a method needs to be declared with 'decreases *' if it may recurse forever _or_ if it contains a possibly infinite loop.  Note that the absence of 'decreases *' on a loop does not mean the loop will terminate but it does mean that the loop will iterate a finite number of times (the subtle distinction here is that a loop without a 'decreases *' is allowed to contain a nested loop that has a 'decreases *' -- provided the enclosing method is also declared with 'decreases *' as previously mentioned)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Minor change due to change in Boogie, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Minor change due to change in Boogie, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added tuples and tuple types. Syntax is the expected one namely parentheses around a comma-delimited list of expressions or types.  Unit and the unit type are denoted ()., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Clarified a refinement point in a test file, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Specialized Lit function for int and real (leaving all other cases polymorphic). This reduces the number of int<->U conversions that Boogie adds which avoids a looping problem in Z3. (Regrettably the test suite seems to have become rather unstable. Sometimes everything verifies and sometimes there is some looping forever.), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Made the snapshotable trees test "unsupported" instead of "unresolved"., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Version 1.8.2.10419 binary release and (except for the "include" update in the previous check-in) rise4fun, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Members included from different files are now internally marked with an IncludeToken; the previous scheme of using {:verify false} is no longer used.  This makes "include" work with refinement features. Filenames of included files used in error messages are now what the user wrote rather than absolute paths (which not only don't look so good but are also problematic in comparing test output on different machines). Added dafny0/Includee.dfy to the test suite as well -- might as well include it too to get checked., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fixed bug #32 dafny.codeplex.com., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Fixed bugs reported as Issue 20. For the first one co-recursive calls are allowed only immediately inside co-constructors (which previously wasn't checked properly). For the second one a resolution error had caused a crash in Dafny. Also tightened up requirement about equality since equality on non-codatatypes can also be destructive (if the type contains a co-datatype value)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Computations!  Generates 'computing' axioms for both all formals and just decreasing formals. Supported are literal datatypes booleans and numbers. The axioms are given a weight of 10 which seems enough for Z3 to give up when it is sane to do so., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Removed the encoding that was used to distinguish datatype values by their type parameters.  Previously this encoding was used in places like the antecedents of function frame axioms.  However not all datatype constructors had this information available so it seems better (for now) to drop this information altogether.  When a full Boogie-term encoding of Dafny types is done then it would be appropriate revisit this issue., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
removed deprecated "allocated" keyword from DafnyExtension syntax highlighting removed a level of directories for the Dafny VIM mode, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Added some axioms to try to recover boxed data.  In particular any element 'x' of a set in the encoding satisfies Box(Unbox(x))==x.  The soundness and performance of the axiomatization are dicey so the axioms are made available only to method in-parameters., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Updated HintPath's of DLL's in the building of DafnyExtension, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Added Test/dafny3 and another test file for iterators (hey you can even run Iter.dfy!) Fixed migration issues, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
More free antecedents when proving well-formedness of iterator specs, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Dafny: fixed bug in looking at the arguments of the :induction attribute, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Jennisys:   - changed the way candidate conditions are discovered; now it simply uses     all sub-expressions found in the spec that evaluate to TrueLiteral   - changed the implementation so that when trying to infer a precondition     try out several different possibilities (and see which one works)   - added some very basic (and incomplete) type inference   - fixed a bug in the Modularizer (it didn't fix the solution after trying     out the spec infered from the solution)   - fixed a bug in DafnyModelUtils so that now when reading from the boogie     model file it keeps getting information from Seq# functions until     reaching a fixpoint (that's needed because the order or reads is important), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Jennisys:   - added concreteValues field to HeapInstance   - brought back reading from Seq#Build when restoring Boogie models   - changed the how the candidate conditions are inferred: now it only     looks for unmodifiable concrete fields   - method in parameter values are added to the list of potential     candidate conditions, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Jennisys:  - changed the synthesis of the Valid() function to synthesize both unrolled    and recursive definition of it because both are needed in certain cases  - to make the recursive definition of Valid() work a "decreases" clause is    needed.  For now decreases clause is always "decreases Repr" and that    seems to be enough for now., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Jennisys: added some more infrastructure for synthesizing read only methods so that now a simple example like Node.Tail work., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

 Jennisys:    - finished the initial version of the modular code for constructors      (excluding the unification part where it tries to find an existing function      that meets the required spec), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
 Jennisys:    - continued to work on the implementation of the modular code for constructors, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Jennisys:   - implemented an initial version of modular code synthesis (where the     initialization code is delegated to receiver objects instead of     modifying their private stuff directly).  For now it just generates     stub methods with appropriate specification.  Another analysis can     be called for such methods to synthesize their bodies., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Merge, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
 Jennisys:    - added a rule to discover when some method arguments are equal and to use      that equality as a potential pre-condition, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Merge, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
 - restored the "old" (as it was before switching from map to list)    ordering of field assignments, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
 - changed heapInst.assignments' type from Map to List (because assignment order can matter)  - fixed a bug in the piece of code for desugaring quantifiers, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Merge, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

 - removed the "Constructor" discriminator from type Member and added a    boolean flag to the "Method" discriminator instead   - added a new example called "List3.jen".  The difference between List2 is    that the IntNode class has a "succ" field that returns a list of all    successor nodes instead of list of integers as in List2.  In this example    the invariant is very verbose because of the lack of better syntax so    maybe we can add some syntactic sugar to Jennisys (e.g. for transitive    closure comprehensions etc.) and synthesize Dafny code from that.   - reading from BVD models now also reads Seq#Append because some lists are    created only that way, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Dafny:  * Big change:  Add type and allocatedness information everywhere in the Boogie translation.  This not only fixes some potential soundness problems (see Test/dafny1/TypeAntecedents.dfy) but it also gives more information about the program.  On the downside it also requires discharging more antecedents in order to use some axioms.  Another downside is that overall performance has gone down (however this may be just an indirect consequence of the change as it was in one investigated case).  * Increase the applicability of function axioms (extending the coarse-grain function/module height mechanism used as an antecedent of function axioms).  (Internally this uses the new canCall mechanism.)  * Extend language with "allocated( Expr )" expressions which for any type of expression "Expr" says that "Expr" is allocated and has the expected type.  * More details error messages about ill-defined expressions (internally by using CheckWellformedness instead of "assert IsTotal")  * Add axioms about idempotence of set union and intersection  * The compiler does not support (the experimental feature) coupling invariants so generate error if the compiler ever gets one  * In the implementation combine common behavior of MatchCaseStmt and MatchCaseExpr into a superclass MatchCase  * Fixed error in translation of while(*), 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Get rid of F# dependencies - use System.Numerics and a custom Rational structure instead, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Eliminated dependencies on SpecSharp and CCI from Boogie.sln and Dafny.sln, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
forgot to check this file in, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Ported all projects to .NET Framework 4.0 in both Boogie.sln and Dafny.sln.  Removed references to Microsoft.Contracts.dll everywhere since that is available in .NET Framework 4.0., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Improved default decreases clauses for methods and functions Dafny:  Don't display "alloc" field in BVD Chalice:  Fixed error-message parsing error in VS mode, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Updated VSComp2010/Answer to correspond to recently updated test file, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Chalice: white space delta in test file Dafny: Simplified VSComp2010/Problem4-Queens.dfy from using an inductive ghost-method lemmas to just using an assert, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: a partial first crack at a Dafny model-viewer provider including captureState mark-ups in the Boogie code generated from Dafny, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Test/dafny1/KatzManna.dfy:  Changed mocked up matrix class to use Dafny's built-in array2 class., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Record source positions of start/end curly braces for declaration constructs. Dafny VS2010 extension:  link with Dafny and use it to parse and type check, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Updated parser.cs files to pick up the new .frame improvements from boogiepartners, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: * Updated Parser.cs/Scanner.cs to use new .frame files from boogiepartners. * It changes for example "syntax error:" to just "error:" so adjusted expected Test outputs. Dafny: * Ditto for its Parser.cs/Scanner.cs. * Added ability to provide a custom Errors handler for scanner/parser. * Added Test/dafny1/Cubes.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added AssemblyInfo.cs missing from previous DafnyExtension check-in, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Update to VS2010., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Util: Minor changes to the LaTeX listings packages for Boogie and Dafny., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Compilation of multi-dimensional arrays, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added full support for multi-dimensional arrays (except for one issue that still needs to be added in compilation) * Changed syntax of array length from |a| to a.Length (for one-dimensional arrays).  The syntax for either dimensions is for example b.Length0 and b.Length1 for 2-dimensional arrays. * Internally this meant adding support for built-in classes and readonly fields, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added internal support for multi-dimensional arrays (but not all surface syntax is there yet) * Removed unused variables from Dafny.atg  Boogie and Dafny: * Improved error message for postcondition violations, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added Dafny solutions to the VSComp 2010 problems, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
VS2010 mode for Dafny and Boogie:  updated for example to properly deal with string literals, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added a command-line option to change the prelude file, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: fallback to ShallowType (elements of IndexField arrays seem to have Type null), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added inlined functions making reads and updates of the heap explicit, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: Adding an autobuild and regression cmd file for Boogie and Dafny - Cleans and builds both projects then executes the regressions if the build succeeded.  If the build had failed it will stop the script., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: Added boolean code expressions (sans well-formedness checks on the input)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Fixed VS 2010 mode to really include all Dafny keywords, 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Dafny: Made line endings consistent, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Removed trailing spaces in code, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fixed some infelicities in the project files., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Port commit part 1.5/2: Committing changed files outside of the Dafny dir.  Do not attempt to regenerate the Parser and Scanner files before the port of Boogie/Core is done as these have undergone changes but will not be committed until after the Core port., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: This file is required by DafnyPipeline., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Port commit part 1/2: Committing changed files.  Do not attempt to regenerate the Parser and Scanner files before the port of Boogie/Core is done as these have undergone changes but will not be committed until after the Core port., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Renaming the DafnyPipeline source files in preparation for the commit of my port of that project., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
fixed path to the binaries directory; there was an extra ..", 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Also build Boogie and Dafny projects in 32-bit configurations. Don't insist on DafnyDriver picking up the LKG version (1.0.21125.0) of the Spec# runtime (in fact most builders will probably have 1.0.21126.0)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Sign both of the Dafny projects and have Dafny.exe get a version number as well., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: DafnyDriver port part 3/3: Updating sources to reference new project., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: DafnyDriver port part 2/3: Adding new dependent file removing unnecessary one., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Dafny/DafnyDriver: Renaming source files in preparation for port commit, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Chalice:  Introduced '[[ S ]]' as a shorthand syntax for 'lock (this) { S }'.  Think of the new brackets as atomicity brackets (see PetersonsAlgorithm.chalice) Chalice:  Added Peterson's algorithm to test suite (safety properties only) VS 2010 integration: Updated Chalice and Dafny modes added keyword highlighting for a new Boogie mode, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Visual Studio 2010 integration for Dafny and Chalice.  See the "How to install binaries" link from the boogie.codeplex.com home page., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Chalice:  No longer use Mask for "held" field; instead only use the value of the "held" field in the heap, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Tortoise SVN screwed up previous commit., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added comments for refinements assertions., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: better error reporting on resolution of refinements. Replace assertions with "if"s to handle errors gently and add cycle detection check., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Axiom about inverting a set union operation similar to the recent ones added for sequence concatenation.  The new SeparationLogicList example profits from this axiom., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: keep counters for loops temporary variables across two implementations in the refinement VC, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * changed rule about scoping of out-parameters * added "refines" "replaces" and "by" as keywords in emacs vim and latex style files, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added a comment noting that this test fails with Z3 2.4., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: Added an additional parameter 'defines' to the method 'BoogiePL.Parser.Parse'., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added assertions in the refinement obligation necessitating that the return values of concrete and abstract executions are equal. Refactored a test to simulate "static" function call., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Support class type parameters in refinements. Added another regression test -- a sequence refined by a singly linked list., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added Carrol Morgan's calculator regression test., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: support input/output parameters in refined methods., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: added a regression test for the refinement extension., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added a simple refinement extension to Dafny. The new keywords are "refines" (for classes and methods) and "replaces .. by" (for coupling invariants.) Extended grammar printer resolver and translator to support this extension. Compiler does not support the extension yet., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Unified the .frame files so that both Boogie and Dafny use exactly the same ones., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
slightly improved syntax file, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * re-introduced the feature where an input filename of "stdin.dfy" says to read the program from standard input * supplied missing case (NotInSet) in Compiler.ssc, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * For every loop decreases clause N generate a free loop invariant N <= N0 where N0 is the value of N just before the loop. * Added Test/dafny1/KatzManna.dfy which contains the 3 programs (and their termination annotations) from the Katz and Manna 1975 paper "A closer look at termination" (which benefits from the feature above)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Updated the frame files to work with the latest Coco/R. This entails *not* having them in this repository because of license issues. Instead they must be downloaded from http://boogiepartners.codeplex.com/ and then copied into the appropriate directories. Lots of code changes to compensate for the new frame files., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: * Set Z3's QI_COST as the sum of "weight" and "generation" not their product.  This worked better when setting the :weight of a quantifier (see below).  Dafny: * Improved axiomatization of sequences; in particular use an axiom to generate terms that say what the two pieces of a concatenation are * Two of the (previous) sequence axioms could cause a matching loop in cases where Z3's arithmetic reasoning does not infer all rational arithmetic equalities during instantiation.  The effect of this was apparently not noticed before perhaps the concatenation/drop properties previously had to be supplied in manual assert statements.  But now with the improved sequence axiomatization (see previous bullet) this effect became remarkably noticeable.  To reduce the bad effect of this apparent matching loop Michal and I added a :weight annotation on two of the axioms which along with the Boogie change above seems to give acceptable results. * Removed several assert lemmas that are no longer needed in Test programs (the test programs now contain only about a handful of such lemmas), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
A simple highlighting syntax file for Vim., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Improved design and implementation of SplitExpr * Fixed some tests in dafny0/Use.dfy * Added test case (in dafny0/Termination.dfy) to test the recent strengthening of set axioms, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added some more set axioms that go "inside out" for union and set differences (UnionOne already had such an axiom) * Fixed bug to once again allow multiple .dfy files on the command line (with the effect of them being merged into one program) * Fixed bug in translation of reads/modifies clauses that mention sequences, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * changed implementation of Test/VSI-Benchmarks/b4.dfy to be more interesting (and in particular different from the specification) * reformatted Test/VSI-Benchmarks/b3.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added two additional heuristics for guessing missing loop decreases clauses (for loop guard A!=B and for loop guards with multiple conjuncts), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Another bug fix in SplitExpr having to do with generic results of function calls, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Fix type bug in SplitExpr translation., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: For functions with an empty decreases clause that use the reads clause instead do not include wildcards., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: * Look for Z3 versions up to 2.15 (but did not implement a better algorithm for it). * Added prover-path output as part of /trace flag (that probably isn't the best command-line option for it).  Dafny: * Split off some tests from Test/dafny0 into Test/dafny1. * Added Test/dafny1/UltraFilter.dfy., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Fixed bug in translation of well-formedness conditions * Added Test/dafny0/Celebrity.dfy * Added a harness to Test/vacid0/Composite.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Allow < and > for comparisons of datatype values (which then compares their ranks), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added arrays * Beefed up set axiomatization to know more things about set displays * Added a simple heuristic that can infer some simple decreases clauses for loops * Added Dafny solutions to a couple of VACID benchmarks, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Fixed crash in parser (that occurred when the Dafny input had a particular parsing error)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: * Added support for polymorphism in lambda expressions * Little clean-up here and there * Added 'then' keyword to emacs and latex modes  Dafny: * Added support for fine-grained framing using the back-tick syntax from Region Logic * Internally changed checking of reads clauses to use a local variable $_Frame analogous to the $_Frame variable used in checking modifies clauses, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Effectively make all in- and out-parameters of ghost methods ghosts. * Added DafnyRuntime.cs back in which is needed to run Dafny programs but which unfortunately is currently not being used in the test suite (something we should address), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Previously a "use" function was one whose definition was applied only in limited ways namely when the function was uttered in a program (possibly in a "use" statement).  Now recursive functions are always limited unless declared with the new modifier "unlimited".  Non-recursive functions are always unlimited.  Also new is that only function calls within the same SCC of the call graph use the limited form of the callee. The "use" modifier is no longer supported.  The "use" statement is still supported now for both limited and unlimited functions; but it's probably better and easier to just explicitly mention a function in an assertion if needed., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Recoded frame axioms to be more goal directed * Added Main test driver to Test/VSI-Benchmarks/b2.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * First crack at a compiler (/compile:1 writes out.cs if Dafny program verifies) * Added "print" statement (to make running compiled programs more interesting) * Changed name of default class from $default to _default Boogie: * Included "lambda" as a keyword in emacs and latex style files, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Removed the previous optional curly braces in match expressions (use parens instead when needed!)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added match statements (in addition to the previous match expressions) * Added missing axiom about boxes and datatypes * Improved axioms for datatype rank comparisons * Added test cases with mutual-recursion termination challenges, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Ensures that function axioms are not being used while their consistency is being checked., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Allow "decreases *" only for loops. * Cosmetic changes in SchorrWaite.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  * Added modules with imports.  These can be used to deal with termination checks without going into method/function implementations.  Imports must be acyclic.  * Added a default module.  It contains all classes/datatypes defined outside the lexical scope of any other module.  * Added a default class.  It contains all class members defined outside the lexical scope of any module and class.  This means that one can write small Dafny programs without any mention of a "class"!  * Revised scheme for termination metrics.  Inter-module calls are allowed iff they follow the import relation.  Intra-module calls where the callee is in another strongly connected component of the call graph are always allowed.  Intra-module calls in the same strongly connected component are verified to terminate via decreases clauses.  * Removed previous hack that allowed methods with no decreases clauses not to be subjected to termination checking.  * Removed or simplified decreases clauses in test suite where possible.  * Fixed error in Test/VSI-Benchmarks/b1.dfy, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Beginning of module implementation * Changed "class" modifier (for functions and methods) to "static", 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added definedness checks for all statements (previously some were missing)  Boogie: Added {:subsumption <n>} attribute to assert statements which overrides the /subsumption command-line setting, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added wellformedness checks to method specifications, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Modifies clause checking is now done with each update instead of at the end of the method.  Not only does this improve error messages but on some examples it gives a dramatic speed-up (2x) in proving time. * bugfix: range expressions of foreach statements were previously ignored during Translation, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Enforce ghost vs. non-ghost separation * Allow ghost parameters and ghost locals * Functions are ghost but allow the non-ghost "function method", 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added stratosphere tests for datatypes--that is it is now checked that every datatype has some value., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added "decreases" clauses to methods. * Interpret the filename stdin.dfy as an indication to read the program from standard input., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Boogie: * Bug fix:  Changed checking of postconditions to follow the order in which ensures clauses are given (not reverse order as was previously the case) * Added command-line option (/instrumentInfer) that decides how to instrument the Boogie program with inferred invariants.  Previously the only option was to instrument at the beginning and end of every basic block.  The new option which is now the default is to instrument only at the beginning of loop heads. * Add empty blocks between other blocks only as needed and try a little harder to retain source information when blocks are peep-hole optimized * Renamed flag /noRemoveEmptyBlocks to /removeEmptyBlocks:<c> where <c> is 0 or 1  Boogie refactoring: * Removed LoopPredicate class and related classes and methods left over from when (back in the Zap 2 days) we supported loop invariants on demand * Cleaned up some parsing of command-line options, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Allow ghost methods (all "ghost" keywords are currently parsed and then ignored) * Improved and made more automatic the treatment of "use" functions (a good next step would be to automatically infer which functions would make good "use" functions) * Include preconditions in all definedness checks of function-call expressions, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: Added if-then-else expressions (replacing and extending the previous boolean-only if-then-else expressions) Dafny: Added 'class' functions and methods (i.e. functions and methods with a receiver parameter) Dafny grammar changes:  Tthe 'use' keyword now goes before 'function' (akin to 'ghost' and 'class') and quantifier triggers now go before the '::' Dafny: Check for division-by-zero for both '/' and '%', 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added support for big integers., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  * Allow (and currently ignore) "ghost" modifier.  * Fixed bug in boxing.  * Check for div-by-zero error for modulo operator.  * Improved emacs and latex modes., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: updated to reflect Boogie's new parsing of function arguments, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
* Added decreases clauses to functions  * If no decreases clause is given the decreases clause defaults to the set of objects denoted by the reads clause which was the previous Dafny behavior  * Made Dafny check loops for termination by default.  Previously this was done only if the loop had a decreases clause.  To indicate that a loop is to be checked only for partial correctness Dafny now allows "decreases *".  * Allow "reads *" to say that the function may read anything at all (sound but not very useful)  * Adjusted frame axioms of functions to speak of allocated objects more liberally; and also added antecedents about the heaps being well-formed and the parameters being allocated  * Added some previously omitted well-definedness checks.  * Fixed some bugs in the resolver that caused some type errors not to be reported  * Added some messages to go with some (previously rather opaquely reported) errors  * Fixed some test cases that previously had ordered conjuncts incorrectly to prove termination and reads checks (such checks were previously omitted)  * Beefed up Test/dafny0/SchorrWaite.dfy to use datatypes to specify that no garbage gets marked.  The full-functional total-correctness verification of this Schorr-Waite method now takes about 3.2 seconds., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added resolution and translation of algebraic datatypes and (in function bodies) match expressions. Addressed a couple of todos including checking the well-formedness of quantifiers and if-then-else expressions in function bodies., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Swapped previous file (Datatypes.bpl) for the correct test file (Datatypes.dfy)., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Start (some parsing and resolution) of adding algebraic datatypes to Dafny. Included VSI-Benchmarks in standard tests., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added a sequence update expression in Dafny., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Redesigned the encoding of Dafny generics including the built-in types set and seq.  Regrettably these changes--although improvements in Dafny's functionality--have caused Test/dafny0/BinaryTree.bpl and Test/dafny0/SchorrWaite.dfy to be significantly slower (the dafny0 test directory now takes 6:11 whereas it used to take 1:43).  Improved some of the VSI-Benchmarks to use generics more fully where the previous designed had just crashed.  Included the previously commented-out loop invariants and assertions in VSI-Benchmarks/b8.dfy.  Added a space in the pretty printing of Boogie coercion expressions., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Applied patch 4316 which fixes an unsoundness in the axiomatization of sequences (for both Dafny and Chalice).  This in turn fixes issue 5876., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
The Dafny call statement now automatically declares left-hand sides as local variables if they were not already local variables., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Introduced operator !in in Dafny.  An expression "x !in S" is equivalent to "!(x in S)". Changed Dafny test files to use the new operator. Included the file b8.dfy into the VSI-Benchmarks test harness., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Added loop invariants to make VSI-Benchmarks/b8.dfy verify.  (Still to do: uncomment a couple of the desired loop invariants.), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fixed PreLoopHeap counting bug., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Initial version of VSI Benchmarks 1 - 8, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Fixed problem where Dafny filenames with unusual characters in filenames had caused malformed Boogie and malformed VCs.  In particular the problem arose in the CEV $file_name_is declarations.  Such characters are now replaced by a percent sign followed by a four-digit hexadecimal number representing the Unicode value of the character. This fixes issue #6057., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
* Boogie and Dafny:  added /cev:<file> option * SscBoogie:  changed default setting for /modifiesOnLoop   (we really should move this SscBoogie-specific code to the Spec# codeplex), 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny:  Added axioms for division and modulo. Dafny:  Make use of function preconditions in function well-definedness checks. Chalice:  Changed old "install" to current "reorder" keyword in Emacs mode., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Dafny: * Added DeclType(f)==C axioms which for each field f says which class declares it.  Boogie: * Changed behavior of free loop invariants.  Now a free loop invariant is ignored on the checking side just like for free requires and free ensures.  The new switch /alwaysAssumeFreeLoopInvariants flag gives the previous behavior. * NOTE:  I did NOT yet make the corresponding change for loop unrolling but it is needed., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Full (?) support in Dafny for Counterexample Visualizer predicates., 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Sign assemblies, 56403253, 497, 31, 497
Incorporated Counterexample Visualizer (CEV) information in the generated Boogie., 56403253, 497, 31, 497

Style and Behavioral Tweaks  First we've updated the style of the discovery trail in presentation mode. The multiple borders were causing weird 1px off issues that resulted in a kludgy looking presenter mode. We've also updated the bookmarks interface so that the EditBookmark component highlights the title when the bookmark is active. We also detect clicks in the bookmark title to indicate it has been activated, 76500490, 12, 0, 12

(netflix) Fix Fast Property impact count or Regions (#3383), 46596023, 9, 4, 9
(netflix) Allow Fast property scope to be updated. (#3375)  Once a Fast Property has been set the scope can't be easily updated b/c the key of the Property is a pipe demilted string of the property key and all the values of its scope.  To get around that limitation we create 2 Persisted property stages.  The first one will create a new property with the new scope.  Once that completes we follow up with a delete property stage that cleans up the origional property.  When editing the property the user will be shown the original scope and they will be able to select the new scope.  If they choose to to update the scope they can remove it and only an upsert property stage will be used., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

(core): pull angular-cron-gen library internally  * pull angular-cron-gen library internally to deck to fix several issues with the library. * the latest version of the library will not allow angular expressions for the new `template-url` property as it uses the `templateUrl` function which executes before the scope is initialized so any scoped property value is not accessible.  this means that our template value set via a controller property is not accessible.  this is a long-standing issue [in the core library](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2895) and it doesn't look to be fixed anytime soon. * an hourly cron trigger set in the UI to execute start at a specific time actually generates a daily cron expression so the portion of the hourly cron trigger that allows starting at a specific time was removed from deck's cron picker template. * the regex used by the library to match hourly cron expressions was incorrectly matching daily cron expressions which was resulting the UI displaying `hourly` instead of `daily` in the select so the regex for hourly was fixed to properly test for matching hourly cron expressions., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

SPIN-1900: Track scrollbar position on pipeline graph (#2461)  * SPIN-1900:  Cadmium has a very long pipeline graph that and the overflow-x: auto kicks in.  Due to the change in the fetch interval to 1 second when every the user scrolls the to the right when the graph repaints it resets the letfScroll on the graph to zero creating a very frustrating user experience.  This seem to only happen when the pipeline is Running.  This fix adds a mousewheel event (scroll was not firing) on the <pipeline-graph> element.  It then saves the scrollLeft posisiton of the scrollbar off to the pipelineGraphService.  When the svg graph redraws it get the scrollLeft offset from the service and sets it.  This prevents the scroll bar from jumping back to the zero position every second.  * remove console.log, 46596023, 9, 4, 9

Fixes SPIN-1772 Promise-ifying all the things.   On initial load of the application the code would attempt to read from the application severGropus before they were loaded causing some asg detail info to go missing (i.e. vpcId)   This was causing the vpcId not to be bound to the asg details on load and in turn display "None (EC2 Classic)" in the VPC field for ASGs that where in vpc0.   This changes leverages the app.ready() promise to verify that all the apps bits are in place before we read them.   @anotherchrisberry PTAL, 46596023, 9, 4, 9

SPIN-1415:  Evict Local Storage if there is an exception on setItem  Our current strategy to only clear out the infrastructureCaches if there is an exception thrown on insert. As the app has grown we have added more and more to Local Storage resulting in the possibility of exhausting the 5MB of space given in most browsers.  This change simply evicts the entire local storage (restricted to the namespace of the url) when there is an insert exception.  This change also reduces the TTL of the 'collapsible section cache' from 30 days to 7 days., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

Fix what's new styling  I simplified the CSS overall here for each respective icon menu.  * The feedback and whats new were actually sharing css which I removed and put in the top level navigation (centering the icons with text) so that all icons in the nav follow the same pattern * Removed duplicated html in the whats new directive by putting the ng-if on the timestamp. * Not super happy about this but put position: fixed; on the timestamp. I honestly think the timestamp should be removed in favor of changing the icon color and having the timestamp in the release notes. It's a very awkward place to put that text and takes up space., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

Improve behavior of Region control on bake stage. Always show Region control on Bake stage ui and on execution ui. Populate choices with provider-specific choices if AWS with exactly ['global'] if not. When switching between providers select the first region if there is exactly one choice. If not check if the region is in the new list of choices. If it is leave it alone. If not clear it. This change was motivated primarily by orca-bakery being unhappy when receiving a bake request with 0 regions. So decided to explicitly specify 'global' as the region when not on AWS., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

Fix for #712: Deploy Stage of Pipeline would reset to default state.  This issue was caused by the multiple watchers on command.capacity.desired causing other watchers to fire in the deployStage.js that are meant to synchronize the state between the pipeline stage object and the command object.  This watcher-chain-of-death was causing the entire stage object to be reset whenever the capacity was changed.  To fix this I replaced the watchers on the directive controller with an function call that just updates the state on an ng-change., 46596023, 9, 4, 9

GCE instanceType data still matches AWS data; need to update it.  commit be205417f084ebdc4408db1f20eb3c3e05fc4d41 Author: Bob T Builder <builds@netflix.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 23:43:00 2014 +0000      [Gradle Release Plugin] - new version commit:  '1.255'.  commit 7d0284bb4d76cc62c5e685fe52be085858e5ae96 Author: chrisb <chrisb@netflix.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 15:13:55 2014 -0800      ignore subnets without purpose  commit fa8b02a940278f32651ba0395a0d37d1880f1d34 Author: duftler <duftler@google.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 11:49:56 2014 -0500      Fixup auto-select behavior when there are no providers specified or there is exactly one specified.     I test this with:       - No providers specified (that is the providers attribute wasn't present at all).       - Just 'aws' specified (the default config in settings.js).       - Both 'aws' and 'gce specified.       - Just 'gce' specified.      Without this fix if just 'gce' was specified 'aws' would still be auto-selected (with no mechanism for selecting 'gce').  commit f8bc17eadac8bdff47615ce62ead4083cfd936b9 Author: duftler <duftler@google.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 10:09:47 2014 -0500      Switched from using ng-options="" to <option ng-repeat="">.  commit 09b80bb88a13bd6b6034de0892c37b63646de465 Author: duftler <duftler@google.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 09:48:59 2014 -0500      Copy placeholder option fix for two remaining pulldowns with static choices.  commit df2faf61a8fceeec5beae54cc65cb244c834ecb1 Author: chrisb <chrisb@netflix.com> Date:   Thu Nov 20 19:02:09 2014 -0800      provide placeholder option for provider select modal  commit 93f09bd2f5d653623fac8beef31b0bc0dabf5d8c Author: Bob T Builder <builds@netflix.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 02:01:57 2014 +0000      [Gradle Release Plugin] - new version commit:  '1.254'.  commit 48808cf81831964ac8131be6a2f6daba7a760e19 Author: duftler <duftler@google.com> Date:   Thu Nov 20 18:20:13 2014 +0000      Fix up GCE Create/Clone Server Group layout by shamelessly copying.

GCE instanceType data still matches AWS data; need to update it.  commit be205417f084ebdc4408db1f20eb3c3e05fc4d41 Author: Bob T Builder <builds@netflix.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 23:43:00 2014 +0000      [Gradle Release Plugin] - new version commit:  '1.255'.  commit 7d0284bb4d76cc62c5e685fe52be085858e5ae96 Author: chrisb <chrisb@netflix.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 15:13:55 2014 -0800      ignore subnets without purpose  commit fa8b02a940278f32651ba0395a0d37d1880f1d34 Author: duftler <duftler@google.com> Date:   Fri Nov 21 11:49:56 2014 -0500      Fixup auto-select behavior when there are no providers specified or there is exactly one specified.

Identify 'Clone Server Group' dialog based on provider type just like 'Create Server Group' dialog. Tweak gce-specific dialog to avoid whatever the javascript-equivalent of NPEs is. Dialog is now shown (for the first time; sweet) and properly progagates the request to gate. Gate forwards the request to orca and then orca responds (correctly) that it can't find 'copyLastAsg_gce'. Working on that next. Doing this one top down: deck->gate->orca->kato, 46596023, 9, 4, 9
